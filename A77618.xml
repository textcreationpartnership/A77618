         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               </gap>ſe,</p>
            <p>Firſt, The afflicting hand of God hath been hard upon my ſelf, and upon my deareſt relations in this world, and upon many of my precious Chriſtian
<pb facs="tcp:170508:4"/> friends, whom I much love and honour in the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which put mee upon ſtudying of the mind of God in that Scripture, that I have made the ſubject matter of this following diſcourſe. <hi>Luther</hi> could not understand ſome Pſalms, till hee was afflicted, the Chriſt-croſs is no letter in the book, and yet ſaith hee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it hath taught mee more than all the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters in the book, afflictions are a golden key, by which the Lord opens the rich treaſures of his word to his peoples ſouls; and this in ſome meaſure through grace<note place="margin">Judg. 14. 9, 10.</note> my ſoul hath experienced; when <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> had found honey, hee gave ſome to his Father and Mother to eat; ſome honey I have found in my following Text, and therefore I may not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bee ſuch a churl, as not to give them ſome of my honey to taſte, who have drunk deep of my gall and worm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood.<note place="margin">Some have accounted nothing their own that they have not communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers.</note>

<pb facs="tcp:170508:5"/> stretched out, what the number of the ſtars is, or what is the courſe of the Sun; but come, and I will tell you the wonders of his grace, the faithfulneſs of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, the riches of his mercy to my ſoul; gracious experiences are to be communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated; <hi>Lilmod Lelammed,</hi> we therefore learn, that wee may teach, is a proverb a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Rabbins;</hi> And I do there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore lay in and lay up, ſaith the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then, that I may draw forth again, and lay out for the good of many; when God hath dealt bountifully with us, others ſhould reap ſome noble good by us; the Family, the Town, the City, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, where a man lives, ſhould fare the better for his faring well; our mercies and experiences ſhould bee as a running ſpring at our doors, which is not onely for our own uſe, but alſo for our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, yea and for strangers too.</p>
            <p>Secondly, What is written is perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, <hi>litera ſcripta manet,</hi> and-ſpreads it ſelf further by far, for time, place and perſons than the voice can reach; the pen is an artificial tongue, it ſpeaks as well to abſent, as to preſent friends; it ſpeaks
<pb facs="tcp:170508:5"/> to them that are afar off, as well as thoſe that are near; it ſpeaks to many thouſands at once; it ſpeaks not onely to the preſent age, but alſo to ſucceeding<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 4 Zech. 1. 5</note> ages; the Pen is a kinde of Image of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity, it will make a man live when hee is dead; though the Prophets do not live for ever, yet their labours may; a mans writings may preach, when hee cannot, when hee may not, and when by reaſon of bodily diſtempers, he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> dares not; yea and that which is more, when hee is not.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Few men, if any, have Iron memories; how ſoon is a Sermon preach'd forgotten, when a Sermon written remains? <hi>Auguſtin</hi> writing to<note place="margin">Auguſt. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſt. 1. ad Voluſ.</note> 
               <hi>Voluſian,</hi> ſaith, That which is written is alwaies at hand to bee read, when the reader is at leaſure; men do not eaſily forget their own names, nor their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers houſe, nor the wives of their bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomes, nor the fruit of their loins nor to eat their daily bread; and yet Ah! how eaſily do they forget that word of grace, that ſhould bee dearer to them than all? moſt mens memories, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in the great concernments of their
<pb facs="tcp:170508:6"/> ſouls are like a ſieve or bowlter, where the good Corn, and fine Flower goes thorow, but the ligh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> chaff and courſe bran remains behinde; or like a ſtrainer, where the ſweet liquor is ſtrained out, but the dreggs are left be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinde; or like a grate, that lets the pure water run away, but if there bee any ſtraws, ſticks, mud, or filth that it holds, as it were with Iron hands, moſt mens memories are very treacherous, especially in good things; few mens memories are a holy Ark, a heavenly Stare-houſe, or Magazine for their ſouls; and therefore they ſtand in the more need of a written word. But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Its marvelous ſuitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and uſefulneſs under theſe great turns and changes that have paſt upon us. As every wiſe husbandman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves the fitteſt ſeaſons to ſow his ſeed; ſome hee ſows in the Autumn, and fall of the leaf, ſome, in the spring<note place="margin">Iſa. 28. 25</note> of the year, ſome in a dry ſeaſon, and ſome in a wet, ſome in a moiſt clay, and ſome in a ſandy dry ground: So every ſpiritual husbandman muſt obſerve the
<pb facs="tcp:170508:6"/> fitteſt times to ſow his spiritual ſeed in, hee hath heavenly ſeed by him for all occaſions and ſeaſons, for ſpring and fall, for all grounds, heads and hearts; now whether the ſeed ſown in the following Treatiſe bee not ſuitable to the times and ſeaſons wherein wee are caſt, is left to the judgement of the prudent Reader to determine; if the Author had thought otherwiſe, this babe had been ſtifled in the womb.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The good acceptance that my other weak labours have found; God hath bleſt them, not onely to the<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 21 Phil. 1. 9, 10, 11</note> conviction, the edification, confirmation, and conſolation of many, but alſo to the converſion of many. God is a free Agent to work by what hand hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and ſometimes hee takes pleaſure<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 17,—29</note> to do great things by weak means, that no fleſh may glory in his preſence. God will not deſpiſe the day of ſmall things, and who or what art thou that dareſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe that day? the Spirit breathes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoſe preaching and writing hee<note place="margin">John 3</note> pleaſes, and all proſpers according as that wind blows.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:170508:7"/>
            <p>Sixthly, That all afflicted and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed Chriſtians may have a proper ſalve for every ſore, a proper remedy againſt every diſeaſe at hand<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good man<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo every good book is not<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 11 That re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy is no remedy, that is not proper to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

            <div type="part">
               <p>For the firſt, <hi>What is the Silence here meant?</hi> I anſwer, there is a ſevenfold Silence.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a Stoical Silence: the Stoicks of old thought it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether below a man that hath rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and underſtanding, either to rejoyce in any good, or to mourn for any evil; but this Stoical Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is ſuch a ſinful unſenſible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:170508:15"/> as is very provoking to a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly God, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 10, 11. God will make the moſt inſenſible ſinner ſenſible, either of his hand here, or of his wrath in Hell. It is a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theniſh and a horrid ſin to be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out natural affections, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 31. And of this ſin <hi>Quintus Fabius Maximus</hi> ſeems to be foulely guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, who when hee heard that his Mother and Wife whom he dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly loved, were ſlain by the fall of an houſe, and that his younger ſon, a brave hopeful young man, died at the ſame time in <hi>Umbria,</hi> hee never changed his countenance, but went on with the affairs of the Common-wealth, as if no ſuch ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity had befallen him; this car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his ſpoke out more ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity than patience.</p>
               <p>And ſo <hi>Harpalus</hi> was not at all appalled, when hee ſaw two of his ſons laid ready dreſt in a charger, when <hi>Aſtyages</hi> had bid him to Supper; this was a ſottiſh inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibleneſs.

Such ſtupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a curſe that many a man lies under: But this Stoical Silence, which is but a ſinful fullenneſs, is not the Silence here meant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a Politick Silence: Many are ſilent out of policy, ſhould they not bee ſilent, they ſhould lay themſelves more open, either to the rage and fury of men, or elſe to the plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of men; to prevent which they are ſilent, and will lay their hands upon their mouths, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may not lay their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their eſtates, lives, or liberties. <hi>And Saul alſo went home to Giheah,</hi>

                  </gap> though hee had been deaf. This new King, being but newly entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170508:17"/> his Kingly Government, and obſerving his condition to bee but mean and low, his friends but few, and his enemies many and potent, Sons of <hi>Belial, i. e.</hi> men without yoak (as the word ſignifies) men that were deſperately wicked, that were mark'd out for hell, that were even incarnate Devils, who would neither ſubmit to reaſon, nor Religion, nor bee governed by the Laws of Nature, nor of Nations, nor yet by the Laws of God; now this young Prince, to prevent ſedition and rebellion,<note place="margin">Hear, ſee, and be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if thou wilt live in peace, is a French Proverb.</note> blood and deſtruction, prudently and politickly chuſes rather to lay his hand upon his mouth, than to take a Woolf by the ear, or a Lion by the beard; hee wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wit nor will to bee mute, hee turns a deaf ear to all they ſay, his unſetled condition requiring Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the ſixth, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> uſed to ſay (<hi>Qui neſcit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, neſcit loqui</hi>) hee that knows not how to bee ſilent, knows not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170508:17"/> how to ſpeak. <hi>Saul</hi> knew this was a time for Silence, hee knew his work was rather to bee an Auditor, than an Oratour: But this is not the Silence the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition ſpeaks of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a fooliſh Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Some fools there bee that can neither do well, nor ſpeak well; and becauſe they cannot word it, neither as they would, nor as they ſhould, they are ſo wiſe as to bee mute, <hi>Prov. 17. 28. Even a fool, when hee holdeth his peace, is counted wiſe: and hee that ſhutteth his lips, is eſteemed a man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> As hee cannot bee wiſe that ſpeaks much, ſo hee cannot bee known for a fool that ſaies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. There are many wiſe fools in the world; there are many ſilly ſouls, who by holding their tongues, gain the credit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being diſcreet men: Hee that doth not diſcover his want of wiſdome by fooliſh babling, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted wiſe, though hee may bee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170508:18"/> otherwiſe. Silence is ſo rare a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, where wiſdome doth regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, that it is accounted a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue where folly doth impoſe it. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was ſo highly honoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the old <hi>Romans,</hi> that they erected Altars to it. That man ſhall paſs for a man of underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who ſo far underſtands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as to hold his tongue: For though it be a great miſery to be a fool, yet it is a greater that a man cannot bee a fool, but hee muſt needs ſhew it: But this fooliſh ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is not the Silence here meant.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a ſullen Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Many to gratifie an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, a luſt, are ſullenly ſilent; theſe are troubled with a dumb Devil, which was the worſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of all the Devils you read of in the Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 17,—28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural Hiſtory mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Lib. 7 cap. 2.</note> mention of a certain people in the Indies upon the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> called <hi>Aſtomi,</hi> that have no mouth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170508:18"/> but do onely feed upon the ſmell of herbs and flowers. Certainly there is a Generation amongſt us, who when they are under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of God, have no mouths to plead with God, no lips to praiſe God, nor no tongues to juſtifie God; theſe are poſſeſſed with a dumb Devil, and this dumb Devil had poſſeſt <hi>Ahab</hi> for a time, 1 <hi>King. 21. 4. And Ahab came into his houſe, heavy and diſpleaſed, and laid him down upon his bed, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away his face, and would eat no bread. Ahabs</hi> ambitious humor, his covetous humor, being croſt, hee is reſolved to ſtarve himſelf, and to dye of the ſullens. A ſullen Silence is both a ſin and a puniſhment; no Devil frets and vexes, wears and waſtes the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a man, like this dumb De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, like this ſullen Silence.</p>
               <p>Some write of a certain Devil whom they call <hi>Hudgin,</hi> who will not (they ſay) hurt any body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee bee wronged. I cannot ſpeak ſo favourably of a ſullen Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170508:19"/> for that wrongs many at once, God and Chriſt, bodies and ſouls: But this is not the Silence here meant.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is a forced Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Many are ſilent perforce; hee that is under the power of his enemie, though hee ſuffer many hard things, yet hee is ſilent under his ſufferings, becauſe hee knows hee is liable to worſe; hee that hath taken away his liberty, may take away his life; hee that hath taken away his money, may take off his head; hee that hath let him blood in the foot, may let him blood in the throat, if hee will not bee ſtill and quiet; and this works Silence perforce: So when many are under the afflicting hand of God, conſcience tells them, that now they are under the hand of an enemy, and the power of that God whom they have diſhonour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoſe Son they have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, whoſe Spirit they have grieved, whoſe righteous Laws
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170508:19"/> they have tranſgreſſed, whoſe Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances they have deſpiſed, and whoſe People they have abuſed and oppoſed. And that hee that hath taken away one childe, may take away every childe; and hee that hath taken away the wife, might have taken away the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and hee that hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way ſome part of the eſtate, might have taken away all the eſtate; and that hee who hath inflicted ſome diſtempers upon the body, might have caſt both body and ſoul into hell fire for ever; and hee that hath ſhut him up in his chamber, may ſhut him out of Heaven at pleaſure: The thoughts and ſenſe<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oculos quos pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum claudit, paena ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Gr. The eye that ſin ſhuts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</note> of theſe things, makes many a ſinner ſilent under the hand of God; but this is but a forced Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: And ſuch was the Silence of <hi>Philip</hi> the ſecond King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who when his invincible Armado that had been three years a fitting, was loſt, hee gave command, that all over <hi>Spain,</hi> they ſhould give thanks to God and the Saints, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170508:20"/> it was no more grievous. As the cudgel forces the Dogg to be quiet and ſtill; and the Rod forces the childe to bee ſilent and mute: ſo the apprehenſions of what God hath done, and of what God may do, forces many a ſoul to bee ſilent, <hi>Jer. 3. 10. 1 King.</hi> 14. 5,—18. But this is not the ſilence here meant; a forced Silence is no Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the eye of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There is a deſpairing Silence: A deſpairing ſoul is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor-Miſſabib,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſa. 94. 17 Pſa. 28. 1</note> a terrour to himſelf, hee hath a hell in his heart, and horrour in his conſcience. Hee looks upwards, and there hee be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds God frowning, and Chriſt bleeding; hee looks inwards, and there hee findes conſcience accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and condemning of him; hee looks on the one ſide of him, and there hee hears all his ſins crying out, wee are thine, and wee will follow thee, wee will to the grave with thee, wee will to judgement with thee, and from
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:170508:20"/> judgement wee will to hell with thee; hee looks on the other ſide of him, and there hee ſees infernal fiends in fearful ſhapes, amazing and terrifying of him, and wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to receive his deſpairing ſoul as ſoon as ſhee ſhall take her leave of his wretched body; hee looks a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove him, and there hee ſees the gates of Heaven ſhut againſt him; hee looks beneath him, and there hee ſees hell gaping for him; and under theſe ſad ſights hee is full of ſecret concluſions againſt his own ſoul; there is mercy for others, ſaith the deſpairing ſoul, but none for mee; grace and favour for others, but none for mee; pardon and peace for others, but none for mee;<note place="margin">As that deſpairing Pope ſaid, the croſs could do him no good, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe hee had ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſold it.</note> bleſſedneſs and happineſs for o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but none for mee; there is no help, there is no hope, no, <hi>Jer. 2. 25. ch.</hi> 18. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

I am ſo troubled that I cannot ſpeak:</hi> But this is not the Silence here meant. But</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, There is a prudent Silence, a holy, a gracious Silence, a Silence that ſprings from prudent principles, from holy principles, and from gracious cauſes and conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and this is the Silence here meant: And this I ſhall fully diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover in my Anſwers to the ſecond Queſtion, which is this,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1 It includes and takes in theſe eight things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It includes a ſight of God, and an acknowledgement of God, as the author of all the afflictions
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:170508:21"/> that come upon us: And this you have plain in the Text, <hi>I was dumb, I opened not my mouth, becauſe thou didst it.</hi> The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt<note place="margin">In ſecond cauſes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times a Chriſtian may ſee much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, hatred, malice, pride, &amp;c. But in the firſt cauſe he can ſee nothing but grace and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and goodneſs.</note> looks through ſecondary cauſes, to the firſt cauſe, and ſo ſits mute before the Lord. There is no ſickneſs ſo little, but God hath a finger in it, though it bee but the aking of the little finger. As the Scribe is more eyed, and properly ſaid to write, than the pen; and hee that maketh and keepeth the Clock, is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaid to make it go and ſtrike, than the wheels and weights that hang upon it; and as every work-man is more eyed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly ſaid to effect his works, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the tools which hee uſeth as his inſtruments: ſo the Lord who is the chief Agent and mover in all actions, and who hath the greateſt hand in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, is more to bee eyed and owned, than any inferiour or ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate cauſes whatſoever. So <hi>Job,</hi> hee beheld God in all, <hi>Job</hi> 1.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170508:22"/> 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away:</hi> Had hee not ſeen God in the affliction, hee would have cried out, Oh theſe wretched <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> they have plundred and ſpoiled mee! Theſe wicked <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans,</hi> they have robbed and wronged mee. <hi>Job</hi> diſcerns Gods Commiſſion in the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> hands, and then laies his own hand upon his mouth. So <hi>Aaron</hi> beholding the hand of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> God in the untimely death of his two ſons, holds his peace, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. the ſight of God in this ſad<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſtroak, is a bridle both to his mind and mouth, hee neither mutters nor murmurs. So <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſaw the hand of God, in his brethrens ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 45. 8. and that ſilences him.</p>
               <p>Men that ſee not God in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, are eaſily caſt into a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh fit, they will quickly bee in a flame, and when their paſſions are up, and their hearts on fire, they will begin to bee ſawcy, and make no bones of telling God to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170508:22"/> his teeth, that they do well to bee angry, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 8, 9. Such as will not acknowledge God to bee the author of all their afflictions, will bee ready enough to fall in with that mad principle of the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, who maintained the Devil to bee the Author of all calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. As if there could bee any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (of affliction) in the City, and the Lord have no hand in it, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. Such as can ſee the ordering hand of God in all their afflictions, will with <hi>David</hi> lay their hands upon their mouths, when the Rod of God is upon their backs, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11, 12. If Gods hand bee not ſeen in the affliction, the heart will do nothing but fret and rage under affliction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It includes and takes in ſome holy gracious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, of the Majeſty, Soveraignty, Dignity, Authority, and preſence of that God, under whoſe afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand we are, <hi>Hab. 2. 20. But the Lord is in his holy Temple, let all the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170508:23"/> earth bee ſilent,</hi> or as the Hebrew reads it, <hi>bee ſilent all the earth before his face.</hi> When God would have all the people of the earth to bee huſht, quiet, and ſilent before him, hee would have them to behold him in his Temple, where hee ſits in ſtate, in majeſty, and glory. <hi>Zephan. 1. 7. Hold thy peace at the preſence of the Lord God.</hi> Chat not, murmure not, repine not, quarrel not: Whiſt, ſtand mute, bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, lay thy hand on thy mouth, when his hand is upon thy back, who is (<hi>totus oculus</hi>) all-eye, to ſee, as well as all hand, to puniſh. As the eyes of a well-drawn picture, are faſtened on thee which way ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou turneſt; ſo are the eies of the Lord; and therefore thou haſt cauſe to ſtand mute before him.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> had an eye to the ſoveraignty of God, and that ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences<note place="margin">Levit. 10. 3 Job 37. 23, 24. 1 Sam. 3. 11,—19.</note> him. And <hi>Job</hi> had an eye upon the majeſty of God, and that ſtills him. And <hi>Elie</hi> had an eye upon the authority and preſence of God, and that quiets him. A man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170508:23"/> never comes to humble himſelf, nor to bee ſilent under the hand of God, till hee comes to ſee the hand of God to bee a mighty hand, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 6. Humble your ſelves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the mighty hand of God.</hi> When men look upon the hand of God as a weak hand, a feeble hand, a low hand, a mean hand, their hearts riſe againſt his hand, <hi>Who is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Lord,</hi> ſaid <hi>Pharaoh, that I ſhould obey his voice?</hi> Exod. 5. 2. And till <hi>Pharaoh</hi> came to ſee the hand of God, as a mighty hand, and to feel it as a mighty hand, hee would not let <hi>Iſrael</hi> go. When <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> a Noble Perſian was arreſted, at firſt hee drew out his ſword and defended himſelf, but when they charged him in the Kings name, and informed him that they came from the King, and were commanded to bring him to the King, he yeelded willingly. So when afflictions arreſt us, we ſhall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and grumble, and ſtruggle and ſtrive even to the death, before wee ſhall yeeld to that God that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170508:24"/> ſtrikes, till wee come to ſee his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and authority, till wee come<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 11, 12 Rev. 1. 5.</note> to ſee him as the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. It is ſuch a ſight of God as this, that makes the heart to ſtoop under his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand. The <hi>Thracians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Herod.</note> ignorant of the dignity and majeſty of God, when it thundred and lightned, uſed to expreſs their madneſs and folly in ſhooting their arrows againſt Heaven, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-wiſe.

                     <hi>Animus cujuſque eſt quiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> the mind is the man.</note> and calmneſſe of mind and ſpirit under the afflicting hand of God: A gracious Silence ſhuts out all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heats, murmurings, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, quarrellings<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wranglings, and boilings of heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 62. 1. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my ſoul keepeth ſilence unto God, or is ſilent or ſtill; that is, my ſoul is quiet and ſubmiſſive to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170508:24"/> God, all murmurings and repine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, paſſions and turbulent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, being allayed, tamed and ſubdued. This alſo is clear in the Text, and in the former inſtances of <hi>Aaron, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> they ſaw that it was a Father that put thoſe bitter cups into their hands, and love, that laid thoſe heavy croſſes upon their ſhoulders, and grace, that put thoſe yoaks about their necks; and this cauſed much quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe and calmneſſe in their ſpirits. <hi>Marius</hi> bit in his pain, when the Chirurgian cut off his legg. Some men, when God cuts off this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that mercy from them, they bite in their pain, they hide and conceal their grief and trouble; but could you but look into their hearts, you would finde all in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, all out of order, all in a flame; and however they may ſeem to be cold without, yet they are all in a hot burning feaver within: Such a feaveriſh fit <hi>David</hi> was once in, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 3. But certainly a holy Silence allaies all tumults in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170508:25"/> mind, and makes a man in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience<note place="margin">Luke 21. 19.</note> to poſſeſſe his own ſoul, which next to his poſſeſſion of God, is the choiceſt and ſweeteſt poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in all the world. The Law of Silence is as well upon that mans heart and mind, as it is upon his tongue, who is truly and divinely ſilent under the rebuking hand of God. As tongue-ſervice abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">Iſa. 29. 13.

A man is then graciouſly ſilent, when all is quiet within and without.</p>

                  <hi>Terpander</hi> a Harper and a Poet, was one, that by the ſweetneſſe of his verſe and muſick, could allay the tumultuous motions of mens minds: As <hi>David</hi> by his Harp did <hi>Sauls.</hi> When Gods people are under the Rod, hee makes by his ſpirit and word ſuch ſweet muſick in their ſouls, as allaies all tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous motions, paſſions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 17, 18, 19.

That thou mayeſt bee juſtified when thou ſpeakeſt, and bee clear when thou judgeſt,</hi> that is, when thou correct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt. Gods judging his people, is Gods correcting or chaſtening of his people, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 32. When wee are judged, wee are chastened of the Lord. Davids</hi> great care when he was under the afflicting hand of God, was to clear the Lord of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice: <hi>Ah Lord</hi> (ſaith hee) <hi>There is not the leaſt ſhew, ſpot, ſtain, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh, or mixture of injuſtice, in all the afflictions thou hast brought upon mee; I deſire to take ſhame to my ſelf, and to ſet to my ſeal that the Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and that there is no injuſtice, no cruelty, nor no extremity in all that the
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:170508:26"/> Lord hath brought upon mee:</hi> And ſo in that, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 75. 137. hee ſweetly and readily ſubſcribes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the righteouſneſs of God in thoſe ſharp and ſmart afflictions that God exerciſed him with. <hi>I know O Lord that thy judgements are right, and that thou in faithfulneſſe haſt afflicted mee. Righteous art thou O Lord, and upright are thy judgements.</hi> Gods judgements are alwaies juſt, hee never afflicts but in faithfulneſſe, his will is the rule of juſtice; and therefore a gracious ſoul dares not cavil nor queſtion his proceedings; the afflicted ſoul knows, that a righteous God can do nothing but that which is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; it knows, that God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable, and therefore the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted man puts his mouth in the duſt, and keeps ſilence before him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10. Who dare ſay, <hi>Wherefore haſt thou done ſo?</hi>

               <p>The Turks, when they are cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elly laſhed, are compelled to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to the judge that commanded it, to kiſs his hand, give him thanks,
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:170508:26"/> and pay the officer that whipped them, and ſo clear the Judge and Officer of injuſtice. Silently to kiſſe the Rod, and the hand that whips with it, is the nobleſt way of clearing the Lord of all inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice.</p>
               <p>The Babyloniſh captivity was the ſoreſt, the heavieſt affliction that ever God inflicted upon any people under Heaven, witneſſe that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 12, &amp;c. yet under thoſe ſmart affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wiſdome is juſtified of her children, <hi>Neh. 9. 33. Thou art just in all that is brought upon us; for thou hast done right, but wee have done wickedly,</hi> 1 Sam. 18. <hi>The Lord is righteous, for I have rebelled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him.</hi> A holy Silence ſhines in nothing more, than in an humble juſtifying and clearing of God from all that which a corrupt heart is apt enough to charge God with in the day of affliction. God, in that hee is good, can give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor do nothing but that which is good, others do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:170508:27"/> hee cannot poſſibly, ſaith <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 120.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, A holy Silence, takes in gracious, bleſſed, ſoul-quieting Concluſions, about the iſſue and event of thoſe afflictions that are upon us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 27,—34. In this choice Scripture you may obſerve theſe five ſoul-ſtilling Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions.</p>
               <p>Firſt, (And that more general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) That they ſhall work for their good, <hi>verſ. 27. It is good for a man that hee bear the yoak in his youth.</hi> A gracious ſoul ſecretly concludes, As ſtars ſhine brighteſt in the night, ſo God will make my ſoul ſhine and gliſter like gold, whilſt I am in this furnace, and when I come out of this furnace of affliction, <hi>Job 23. 10. Hee knoweth the way that I take; and when hee hath tried mee, I ſhall come forth as gold.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Surely as the taſting of hony did open <hi>Jonathans</hi> eyes, ſo this croſs, this affliction, ſhall open
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:170508:27"/> mine eyes; by this ſtroak I ſhall come to have a clearer ſight of my ſins, and of my ſelf, and a fuller ſight of my God, <hi>Job 33. 27, 28. Job 40. 4, 5. chap.</hi> 42. 1,—7.</p>
               <p>Surely this affliction ſhall iſſue in the purging away of my droſſe, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 25.</p>
               <p>Surely as plowing of the ground killeth the weeds, and harrowing breaketh hard clots, ſo theſe af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions ſhall kill my ſins, and ſoften my heart, <hi>Hoſ. 5. ult. chap.</hi> 6. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Surely as the plaiſter draws out the core, ſo the afflictions that are upon mee, ſhall draw out the core of pride, the core of ſelf-love, the core of envy, the core of earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, the core of formality, the core of hypocriſie, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67, 71.</p>
               <p>Surely by theſe the Lord will crucifie my heart more and more to the world, and the world to my heart, <hi>Gal. 6. 14. Pſal.</hi> 131. 1, 2, 3.</p>
               <p>Surely by theſe afflictions the Lord will hide pride from my ſoul, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 14,—21.</p>
               <pb n="30" facs="tcp:170508:28"/>
               <p>Surely theſe afflictions are but the Lords pruning-knives, by which hee will bleed my ſins, and prune my heart, and make it more fertil and fruitful; they are but the Lords potion, by which hee will clear mee, and rid mee of thoſe ſpiritual diſeaſes and maladies which are moſt deadly and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to my ſoul.</p>
               <p>Affliction is ſuch a potion, as will carry away all ill humours, better than all the <hi>benedicta medicamenta,</hi> as Phyſicians call them, <hi>Zach.</hi> 13. 8<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 9.</p>
               <p>Surely theſe ſhall encreaſe my ſpiritual experiences, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 3, 4</p>
               <p>Surely by theſe I ſhall bee made more partaker of Gods holineſſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. As black ſope makes white cloaths: ſo doth ſharp affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions make holy hearts.</p>

               <p>Surely by theſe afflictions the Lord will draw out my heart more and more to ſeek him, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 16.
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:170508:28"/> 
                  <hi>Tatianus</hi> told the Heathen Greeks, that when they were ſick, then they would ſend for their gods to be with them, as <hi>Agamem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> did at the ſiege of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſend for his ten Counſellors. <hi>Hoſ. 5. 15.

               <p>Surely by theſe trials and troubles, the Lord will fix my ſoul more than ever upon the great concernments of another world, <hi>Joh. 14. 1, 2, 3. Rom. 8. 17, 18. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thirdly, The third ſoul-quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Concluſion you have in <hi>verſ. 31. For the Lord will not cast off for ever;</hi> the Rod ſhall not alwaies lye upon the back of the righteous. <hi>At even-tide lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Firſt, A holy, a prudent Silence under affliction, doth not exclude and ſhut out a ſenſe and feeling of

Hee is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of his pain, as well as of his ſin; and having prayed off his ſin in the former verſes, hee labours here to pray off his pain; diſeaſes, aches, ſickneſſes, pains, they are all the daughters of ſin, and hee that is not ſenſible of them, as the births and products of ſin, doth but add to his ſin, and provoke the Lord to add to his ſufferings, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26. 9, 10, 11. No man ſhall ever bee charged by God for feeling his burden, if hee neither fret nor faint under it; grace doth not deſtroy nature, but rather perfect it, grace is of a noble off-ſpring, it neither turneth men into ſtocks, nor to
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:170508:36"/> Stoicks; the more grace, the more ſenſible of the tokens, frowns, blows, and laſhes of a diſpleaſed Father. Though <hi>Calvin</hi> under his greateſt pains, was never heard to mutter, nor murmure, yet hee was heard often to ſay, <hi>How long Lord, how long?</hi> A religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander being ſhot in battel, when the wound was ſearch'd, and the bullet cut out, ſome ſtanding by pittying his pains, hee replied, though I groan, yet I bleſs God I do not grumble: God allowes his people to groan, though not to grumble. It is a God-provoking ſin to bee ſtupid and ſenſeleſs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the afflicting hand of God. God will heat that mans furnace of affliction ſevenfold hotter, who is in the furnace, but feels it not, <hi>Iſa. 42. 24, 25. Who gave Jacob for a ſpoil, and Iſrael to the Robbers? did</hi>

                  <hi>not the Lord, he, against whom we have ſinned? for they would not walk in his waies, neither were they obedient unto his Law. Therefore hee hath poured upon him the fury of his anger, and the

               <p>The Phyſician, when hee find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that the potion which hee hath given his patient will not work, hee ſeconds it with one more vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, and if that will not work, hee gives another yet more violent. If a gentle plaiſter will not ſerve, then the Chirurgion applies that which is more corroding, and if that will not do, then hee makes uſe of his cauterizing knife: So when the Lord afflicts, and men feel it not, when hee ſtrikes, and they grieve not, when hee wounds them, and they awake not, then the furnace is made hotter than ever; then his fury burns, then hee laies on Irons upon Irons, bolt upon bolt, and chain upon chain, until hee hath made their lives a hell. Afflictions are the Saints dyet-drink, and where do you read in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:170508:37"/> that ever any of the Saints drunk of this dyet-drink, and were not ſenſible of it?</p>
               <p>Secondly, A holy, a prudent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doth not ſhut out prayer for<note place="margin">It is an old ſaying, (<hi>Qui neſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cit or are, diſcat na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigare</hi>) Hee that would learn to pray, let him go to Sea.</note> deliverance out of our afflictions; though the Pſalmiſt layes his hand upon his mouth, in the Text, yet hee prayes for deliverance, <hi>verſ. 10, Remove thy ſtroak away from mee,</hi> and <hi>verſ. 11, 12. Hear my prayer, O Lord, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears: For I am a ſtranger with thee, and a ſojour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, as all my Fathers were.

<pb n="49" facs="tcp:170508:37"/> my ſoul. Jonah</hi> praies in the Whales belly, and <hi>Daniel</hi> praies when a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Lions, and <hi>Job</hi> praies when on the dunghil, and <hi>Jeremiah</hi> praies when in the dungeon; &amp;c. Yea the Heathen Mariners, as ſtout as they were, when in a ſtorm, they cry every man to his God, <hi>Jonah</hi> 1. 5, 6. to call upon God eſpecially in times of diſtreſs and trouble, is a leſſon that the very light and law of nature teaches. The <hi>Perſian</hi> Meſſenger (though an Heathen) as <hi>Aeſchiles</hi> obſerveth, ſaith thus, When the <hi>Graecian</hi> forces hotly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued our hoſt, and wee muſt needs venture over the great water <hi>Stry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon,</hi> frozen then, but beginning to thaw, when a hundred to one wee had all died for it; With mine eies I ſaw, ſaith hee, many of thoſe Gallants, whom I had heard before, ſo boldly maintain, There was no God, every one upon his knees, and devoutly praying that the Ice might hold till they got over. And ſhall blinde nature do more than grace? If the time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:170508:38"/> bee not a time of ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I know not what is.</p>
               <p>As there are two kinds of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dotes againſt poiſon, <hi>viz.</hi> hot and cold; ſo there are two kinds of Antidotes againſt all the troubles and afflictions of this life, <hi>viz.</hi> prayer and patience, the one hot, the other cold, the one quenching, the other quickning. <hi>Chryſostome</hi> underſtood this well enough, when hee cryed out, O! (ſaith hee) it is more bitter than death to be ſpoiled of prayer, and thereupon obſerves, that <hi>Daniel</hi> choſe rather to run the hazard of his life, than to loſe his prayer: Well, this is the ſecond thing; a holy Silence doth not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude prayer. But<note place="margin">Read the 9th. of Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra, the 9th. of Nehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah, and the 9th. of Daniel, and Pſalm 51. with that 7th. chapter of Job.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, A holy, a prudent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doth not exclude mens being kindly affected and afflicted with their ſins, as the meritorious cauſe of all their ſorrows and ſufferings, <hi>Lam. 3. 39, 40. Wherefore doth a living man complain, a man for the puniſhment of his ſin? Let us ſearch
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:170508:38"/> and try our waies, and turn again to the Lord.</hi> Job 40. 4, 5. <hi>Behold, I am vile, what ſhall I anſwer thee? I will lay my hand upon my mouth. Once have I ſpoken, but I will not anſwer: yea twice, but I proceed no further.</hi> Micah 7. 9. <hi>I will bear the indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Lord, becauſe I have ſinned.</hi> In all our ſorrows wee ſhould read our ſins, and when Gods hand is upon our backs, our hands ſhould bee upon our ſins.</p>
               <p>It was a good ſaying of one, I<note place="margin">Vivaldus.</note> hide not my ſins, but I ſhew them, I wipe them not away, but I ſprinkle them, I do not excuſe them, but accuſe them: The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of my ſalvation is the knowledge of my tranſgreſſion. When ſome told Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (that <hi>delitiae generis humani</hi>) that darling of mankind, that the ſins of the people brought that affliction on him; O no, ſaid hee. I have ſins enough of mine own to cauſe that; I have ſinned, ſaith <hi>David,</hi> but what have theſe poor ſheep done? When a Chriſtian is under
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:170508:39"/> the afflicting hand of God, hee may well ſay, I may thank this proud heart of mine, this worldly heart, this froward heart, this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal heart, this dull heart, this backſliding heart, this ſelf-ſeeking heart of mine, for that this cup is ſo bitter, this pain ſo grievous, this loſs ſo great, this diſeaſe ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, this wound ſo incurable; it is mine own ſelf, mine own ſin, that hath cauſed theſe floods of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to break in upon mee. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, A holy, a prudent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doth not exclude the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inſtructing of others when wee are afflicted; the words of the afflicted ſtick cloſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they many times work ſtrongly, powerfully, ſtrangely, ſavingly upon the ſouls and conſciences of others. Many of <hi>Pauls</hi> Epiſtles were written to the Churches when hee was in bonds, <hi>viz. Galatians, Epheſians, Philippians, Coloſſians, Philemon;</hi> hee begot <hi>Oneſimus</hi> in his bonds, <hi>Phil.</hi> 10. And many of the brethren in
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:170508:39"/> the Lord waxed bold and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by his bonds, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, and made partakers of grace by his Miniſtery, when hee was in bonds, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1. 7. 13, 14. As the words of dying perſons do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ſtick and work gloriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; ſo many times doth the words of afflicted perſons, work very noblely and efficaciouſly. I have read of one <hi>Adrianus,</hi> who ſeeing the Martyrs ſuffer ſuch grievous things in the cauſe of Chriſt, hee asked what that was which inabled them to ſuffer ſuch things? and one of them named that, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9. Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither have entred into the heart of man, the things which God hath prepared for them that love him:</hi> This word was like Apples of<note place="margin">Prov. 25. 11</note> Gold, in Pictures of Silver, for it made him not onely a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert, but a Martyr too. And this was the means of <hi>Justin Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs</hi> converſion, as himſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth. Doubtleſs many have been made happy by the words of the
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170508:40"/> afflicted; the tongue of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted hath been to many as choice ſilver, the words of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted many times are both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and profitable; they tickle the ear, and they win upon the heart; they ſlide inſenſibly into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers ſouls, &amp; work efficaciouſly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearers hearts. <hi>Eccleſ. 10. 12. The words of a wiſe mans mouth are gracious</hi> (or <hi>Grace,</hi> as the Hebrew hath it;) and ſo <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it, <hi>Verba oris ſapientis gratia,</hi> the words of the mouth of a wiſe man are grace: They miniſter grace to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they win grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from others; gracious lips make gracious hearts; gracious words are a grace, an ornament to the ſpeaker, and they are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, a delight, and an advantage to the hearer.</p>
               <p>Now the words of a wiſe mans mouth, are never more gracious, than when hee is moſt afflicted and diſtreſſed. Now you ſhall finde moſt worth and weight in his words: Now his lips like the
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:170508:40"/> Spouſes, are like a threed of Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let, they are red, with talking much of a crucified Chriſt, and they are thin, like a thred not ſwell'd with vain and unprofitable diſcourſes. Now his mouth ſpeaketh wiſdome, and his tongue talketh judgement, for the Law of the Lord is in his heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 37. 30. now his lips drop hony-combs, <hi>Cant.</hi> 4. 10. now his tongue is as a tree of life, whoſe leaves are medicinable, <hi>Prov.</hi> 12. 18.<note place="margin">Numb. 10. 10</note> As the ſilver Trumpets ſounded moſt joy to the Jews in the day of their gladneſſe; ſo the mouth of a wiſe man, like a ſilver Trumpet, ſounds moſt joy and advantage to others in the daies of his ſadneſſe.</p>
               <p>The Heathen man could ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> (<hi>Quand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Fifthly, A holy, a prudent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,

There is no water ſo ſweet, as the Saints tears, when they do not overflow the banks of moderation; tears are not mutes, they have a voice, and their oratory is of great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valency<note place="margin">And the Greeks call the apple of the eye, the damſel of the eye, the girle of the eye, and the Latines call it the babe of the eye.</note> with the Almighty God. And therefore the weeping Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet calleth out for tears, <hi>Lam. 2. 18. Their heart crieth unto the Lord, O wall of the daughter of Zion, let tears run down like a river day and night, give thy ſelf no reſt, let not the apple of thine eye ceaſe,</hi> or as the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew hath it, <hi>let not the daughters of thine eye bee ſilent</hi> (that which wee call the ball or apple of the eye,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:170508:41"/> the Hebrews call the daughter of the eye, becauſe it is as dear and tender to a man, as an onely daughter; and becauſe therein ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears the likeneſſe of a little daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.) Upon which words, ſaith <hi>Bellarmine, Clames aſſidue ad Deum; non lingua, ſed oculis; non verbis, ſed lachrymis; iſta enim eſt oratio, quae placare ſolet:</hi> Cry aloud, not with thy tongue, but with thine eyes; not with thy words, but with thy tears; for that is the prayer that maketh the moſt forcible entry into the ears of the great God of Heaven. When God ſtrikes, hee looks that wee ſhould tremble; when his hand is lifted high, hee looks that our hearts ſhould ſtoop low; when hee hath the rod in his hand, hee looks that wee ſhould have tears in our eyes; as you may ſee by comparing of theſe Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures together, <hi>Pſal. 55. 2. Pſal. 38. 6. Job</hi> 30. 26,—32. Good men weep eaſily, ſaith the Greek Poet; and the better any are, the more enclining to weeping, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:170508:42"/> under affliction. As you may ſee in <hi>David</hi> (whoſe tears inſtead of Gemms, were the common or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naments of his bed) <hi>Jonathan, Job, Ezra, Daniel, &amp;c.</hi> How (ſaith one) ſhall God wipe away my tears in Heaven, if I ſhed none on earth? and how ſhall I reap in joy, if I low not in tears? I was both with tears, and I ſhall die with tears; and why then ſhould I live without them in this valley of tears?</p>
               <p>There is as well a time to weep, as there is a time to laugh; and a time to mourn, as well as a time to dance, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 3. 4.

A fourth reaſon why the people of God ſhould bee mute and ſilent under their afflictions, is this, becauſe it is ten thouſand times a greater judgement and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to bee given up to a fretful ſpirit, a froward ſpirit, a muttering or murmuring ſpirit under an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, than it is to bee afflicted.

When the rolling bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle lies ſtill, you may pour into it your ſweeteſt or your ſtrongeſt wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; when the rolling tumbling ſoul lies ſtill, then God can beſt pour into it the ſweet waters of mercy, and the ſtrong waters of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine conſolation.

Many when they feel the Rod to ſmart, ah how do they fret and fume! <hi>Iſa. 8. 21. When they were hardly beſtead and hungry, they fret themſelves, and curſe their King, and their God.</hi> Prov. 19. 3. <hi>The fooliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man perverteth his way; and his heart fretteth againſt the Lord.</hi> The heart may bee fretful and<note place="margin">2 King. 6. 33 Pſal. 37. 1, 7, 8</note> froward, when the tongue doth not blaſpheme. Folly brings man into miſery, and miſery makes man to fret; man in miſery is more apt to fret and chafe againſt the Lord, than to fret and chafe againſt his ſin that hath brought him in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſufferings. A fretful ſoul dares let fly at God himſelf. When

God will vex every vein in that mans heart, before hee hath done with him, who fumes and frets, becauſe hee cannot ſnap in ſunder the cords with which hee is bound, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16. 43. Sometimes good men are ſick of the frets, but when they are, it coſts them dear; as <hi>Job</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> found by expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience. No man hath ever got any thing by his fretting and fling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, except it hath been harder blows, or heavier chains; therefore fret not when God ſtrikes.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, This truth looks ſourely upon thoſe who charge God fooliſhly, in the day of their
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:170508:61"/> adverſity, <hi>Lam. 3. 39. Why doth a</hi>

It is a very evil thing when wee ſhall go to accuſe God, that wee may excuſe our ſelves, and unblame our ſelves, that wee may blame our God, and lay the fault any where, rather than upon our own hearts and waies. <hi>Job</hi> was a man of a more noble ſpirit, <hi>Job 1. 22. In all this Job ſinned not, nor charged God fooliſhly.</hi> When God charges ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny men home, then they preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge God fooliſhly, they put him to bear the brunt and blame of all, but this will bee bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs in the end: When thou
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:170508:61"/> art under affliction, thou mayeſt humbly tell God that thou feeleſt his hand heavy, but thou muſt not blame him becauſe his hand is heavy. No man hath ever yet been able to make good a charge againſt God, and wilt thou bee able? ſurely no. By charging God fooliſhly in the day of thy calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thou doſt but provoke the Lord to charge thee thorow, and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, more fiercely, and furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, with his moſt deadly darts of renewed miſery; it is thy greateſt wiſdome to blame thy ſins, and lay thy hand upon thy mouth; for why ſhould folly charge innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy? That man is far enough off from being mute and ſilent under the hand of God, who dares charge God himſelf for laying his hand upon him. But<note place="margin">Exod. 32. 11 Pſal. 10. 1 Pſal, 22. 1, 2 Job 3. 11, 12. ch. 19. 11, 13, 14.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, This truth looks ſourely and ſadly upon ſuch as will not bee ſilent, nor ſatisfied under the afflicting hand of God, except the Lord will give them
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170508:62"/> the particular reaſons why hee laies his hand upon them. Good men ſometimes daſh their feet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt this ſtumbling-ſtone, <hi>Jer. 15. 18. Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable? &amp;c.</hi> Though God hath alwaies reaſon for what hee doth, yet hee is not bound to ſhew us the reaſons of his doings. <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s paſſion was up, his blood was hot, and now nothing will ſilence nor ſatisfie him, but the reaſons why his pain was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and his wound incurable, So <hi>Job, chap. 7. 20. Why haſt thou ſet mee as a mark against thee, ſo that I am a burden to my ſelf?</hi> It is an evil and a dangerous thing to cavil at, or to queſtion his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, who is the chief Lord of<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20 Dan. 4. 34, 35</note> all, and who may do with his own what hee pleaſeth? Hee is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and uncontroulable; and therefore who ſhall ſay what doeſt thou? As no man may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion his right to afflict him, nor his righteouſneſs in afflicting of him; ſo no man may queſtion the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170508:62"/> reaſons why he afflicts him. As no man can compel him to give a reaſon of his doings; ſo no man may dare to ask him the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaſons of his doings. Kings think themſelves not bound to give their ſubjects a reaſon of their<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 8. 4</note> doings; and ſhall wee binde God to give us a reaſon of his doings? who is the King of Kings, and<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5, 6</note> Lord of Lords, and whoſe will is the true reaſon, and onely rule of juſtice. The general grounds and reaſons that God hath laid down in his word, why hee afflicts his people, as <hi>viz.</hi> for their profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. for the purging away of their ſins, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 25. for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of their lives, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119. 67. 71. and for the ſaving of their ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32. ſhould work them to bee ſilent and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied under all their afflictions, though God ſhould never ſatisfie their curioſity in giving them an account of ſome more hidden cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which may lye ſecret in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byſs of his eternal knowledge, and
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:170508:63"/> infallible will. Curioſity is the ſpiritual drunkenneſs of the ſoul; and look, as the drunkard will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver bee ſatisfied, bee the cup never ſo deep, unleſs hee ſee the bottome of it; ſo ſome curious Chriſtians, whoſe ſouls are over-ſpread with the leproſie of curioſity, they will never bee ſatisfied, till they come to ſee the bottome, and the moſt ſecret reaſons of all Gods dealings towards them; but they are fools in folio, who affect to know more than God would have them: Did not <hi>Adams</hi> curioſity render him and his poſterity fools in folio? and what pleaſure can wee take to ſee our ſelves every day fools in print? As a man by gazing and prying into the body of the Sun may grow dark and dim, and ſee leſs than otherwiſe hee might: So many by a curious prying into the ſecret reaſons of Gods dealings with them, come to grow ſo dark and dim, that they cannot ſee thoſe plain reaſons that God hath laid down in his word, why hee
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:170508:63"/> afflicts and tries the children of men.</p>
               <p>I have read of one Sir <hi>William</hi>

                  <hi>Herod</hi> was eaten up of Lice, Pope <hi>Adrian</hi> was choaked with a Gnat. A Mouſe is but little, yet killeth an Elephant, if hee gets up into his Trunck; a Scorpion is little, yet able to ſting a Lion to death; though the Leopard bee great, yet hee is poiſoned with a head of Garlick: the leaſt ſpark may conſume the greateſt houſe; and the leaſt leak ſink the greateſt ſhip: a whole arm hath been impoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated with the prick of a little finger; A little Poſtern opened, may betray the greateſt City; A dram of poiſon diffuſeth it ſelf to all parts, till it ſtrangle the vital ſpirits, and turn out the ſoul from the body; if the Serpent can but wriggle in his tail, by an evil thought, hee will ſoon make a ſurpriſal of the ſoul, as you ſee in that great inſtance of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> The trees of the forreſt (ſaith one in a Parable) held a ſolemn Parliament, wherein they conſulted of the innumerable wrongs which the Axc had done

               <p>Secondly, Conſider, it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible thing for any to ſin them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves out of their troubles. <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Job,</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi> attempts it, but could not effect it: the devils have experienced this near this ſix<note place="margin">Jer. 2. 36, 37. ch. 17. 5, 6, 11.</note> thouſand years, they had not been now in chains, could they but have ſinned themſelves out of their chains; could the damned ſin<note place="margin">Jude 6.</note>

               <p>Thirdly, As it is an impoſſible thing, ſo it is a very prejudical, a very dangerous thing, to attempt

               <p>Fourthly, Conſider, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignoble and unworthy thing, to go to ſin your ſelves out of your troubles and ſtraights; it argues a poor, a low, a weak, a daſterdly, and an effeminate ſpirit, to uſe baſe ſhifts, to ſhuffle your ſelves out of your troubles.

               <p>Sixthly and laſtly, Conſider this, that your very attempting to ſin, and ſhift your ſelves out of troubles and afflictions, will coſt you dear; it will coſt you many prayers, many tears, many ſighs,<note place="margin">A man may buy any thing too dear, but Chriſt, Grace, his own Soul, and the Goſpel.</note> many groans, many gripes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terrours, and many horrours. <hi>Peter</hi> by attempting to ſin himſelf out of trouble, ſins himſelf into a Sea of ſorrows, <hi>Matth. 26. ult.

The Bee ſucks ſweet hony out of the bittereſt herbs: ſo God will by afflictions teach his children to ſuck ſweet knowledge, ſweet obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and ſweet experiences, &amp;c. out of all the bitter afflictions and trials hee exerciſes them with; that ſcouring and rubbing which frets others, ſhall make them ſhine the brighter, and that weight which cruſhes and keeps others under, ſhall but make them like the palm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tree, grow better and higher. And that hammer which knocks o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers all in peeces, ſhall but knock them the nearer to Chriſt the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone. Stars ſhine brighteſt in the darkeſt night: Torches give the beſt light, when beaten: Grapes yeeld moſt Wine, when moſt preſſed: Spices ſmell ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, when pounded; Vines are the

Affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions are the Saints beſt benefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors to heavenly affections; where afflictions hang heavieſt, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions hang looſeſt. And grace that is hid in nature, as ſweet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Roſe-leaves, is then moſt fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, when the fire of affliction is put under to diſtill it out. Grace ſhines the brighter for ſcouring, and is moſt glorious, when it is moſt clouded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural hiſtory,<note place="margin">Lib. 12. cap. 9.</note> writeth of certain Trees growing in the red Seas, which being beat upon by the waves, ſtand like a
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:170508:74"/> rock, immoveable, and that they are bettered by the roughneſs of the waters. In the Sea of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions God will make his people ſtand like a rock, they ſhall bee immoveable, and invincible, and the more the waves of afflictions beat upon them, the better they ſhall bee, the more they ſhall thrive in grace and godlineſs. Now how ſhould this ingage Chriſtians to bee mute and ſilent under all their troubles and trials in this world, conſidering that they ſhall all work for their good? God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſes our carkaſſes, to heal our conſciences, hee afflicts our bodies, to ſave our ſouls, hee gives us gall and wormwood here, that the pleaſures that bee at his right hand may bee the more ſweet hereafter; here hee layes us upon a bed of thorns, that wee may look and long more for that eaſie bed of down (his boſome) in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>
               <p>As there is a curſe wrapt up in the beſt things hee gives the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:170508:74"/> ſo there is a bleſſing wrapt up<note place="margin">Pſa. 25. 10. Deut. 28 26</note> in the worſt things hee brings up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own. As there is a curſe wrapt up in a wicked mans health, ſo there is a bleſſing wrapt up in a godly mans ſickneſs: As there is a curſe wrapt up in a wicked mans ſtrength, ſo there is a bleſſing wrapt up in a godly mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: As there is a curſe wrapt up in a wicked mans wealth, ſo there is a bleſſing wrapt up in a godly mans want: As there is a curſe wrapt up in a wicked mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, ſo there is a bleſſing wrapt up in a godly mans reproach: As there is a curſe wrapt up in all a wicked mans mercies, ſo there is a bleſſing wrapt up in all a godly mans croſſes, loſſes, and changes: and why then ſhould hee not ſit mute and ſilent before the Lord? But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Conſider, That a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſilence is that excellent precious grace, that lends a hand of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to every grace. Silence is<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4</note>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:170508:75"/> 
                  <hi>Custos,</hi> the Keeper of all other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, it lends a hand to Faith, a hand to Hope, a hand to Love, a hand to Humility, a hand to Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, &amp;c. A holy ſilence hath its influences upon all other graces that bee in the ſoul, it cauſes the Roſe-buds of grace to bloſſome and bud forth. Silence is (<hi>virtus verſata circa adverſa</hi>) a grace that keeps a man gracious in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; in every condition Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is a Chriſtians right hand; in proſperity, it bears the ſoul up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the envy, malice, hatred and cenſures of the world; in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity, it bears the ſoul up under all the neglect, ſcorn and contempt that a Chriſtian meets with in the world; it makes every bitter ſweet, every burden light, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yoak eaſie. And this the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathen ſeemed to intimate in placing the Image of <hi>Angeronia</hi> with the mouth bound upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of <hi>Volupia,</hi> to ſhew, that ſilence under ſufferings, was the ready way to attain true comfort, and make
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170508:75"/> every bitter ſweet. No man ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, nor no man juſtifies God at ſo high a rate, as hee who layes his hand upon his mouth, when the Rod of God is upon his back. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To move you to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under your ſoreſt and your ſharpeſt trials, conſider, That you<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39 Mic. 7. 7, 8, 9</note> have deſerved greater and heavier afflictions than thoſe you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; hath God taken away one mercy? thou haſt deſerved to bee ſtript of all; hath hee taken away the delight of thine eyes? he might have taken away the delight of thy ſoul; art thou under outward wants? thou haſt deſerved to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der outward and inward together; art thou caſt upon a ſick-bed? thou haſt deſerved a bed in Hell; art thou under this ach and that pain? thou haſt deſerved to bee under all aches and pains at once; hath God chaſtiſed thee with whips? thou haſt deſerved to bee chaſtiſed with<note place="margin">1 King. 12. 11, 14.</note> Scorpions; art thou fallen from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170508:76"/> the higheſt pinacle of honour to be the ſcorn and contempt of men? thou haſt deſerved to bee ſcorned and contemned by God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; art thou under a ſevere whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? thou haſt deſerved an utter damning. Ah Chriſtians! let but your eyes bee fixt upon your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, and your hands will bee quickly upon your mouths; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is leſs than a final ſeparation from God, whatever is leſs than Hell, is mercy; and therefore you have cauſe to bee ſilent under the ſmarteſt dealings of God with you. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly, Conſider, A quiet ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpirit is of great eſteem with God: God ſets the greateſt value upon perſons of a quiet ſpirit, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 4. But let it bee the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet ſpirit, which is in the ſight of God of great price.</hi> A quiet ſpirit is a ſpark of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a ray, a beam of glory,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170508:76"/> it is a heaven-born ſpirit: No man is born with a holy Silence in his heart, as hee is born with a tongue in his mouth: this is a flower of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, it is a precious Jem that God makes very great reckoning of. A quiet ſpirit ſpeaks a man moſt like to God, it capacitates a man for communion with God, it renders a man moſt ſerviceable to God, and it obliges a man to moſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate walking with God: A meek and quiet ſpirit is an incorruptible ornament, much more valuable than gold.</p>
               <p>Firſt, There is a natural quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which proceeds from a good temper and conſtitution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a moral quietneſs, which proceeds from good education and breeding, which flows from good injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inſtructions, and examples.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is an artificial
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170508:77"/> quietneſs; ſome have an art to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſon their paſſions, and to lay a Law of reſtraint upon their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath, when they are all in a flame within: As you may<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 20,—33</note> ſee in <hi>Cain, Eſau, Abſalom,</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> who for a time caſt a cloſe cloak over their malice, when their hearts were ſet on fire of Hell: ſo <hi>Domitian</hi> would ſeem to love them beſt, whom hee willed leaſt ſhould live.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a gracious quietneſs which is of the ſpirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22,—25. Now this quietneſs of ſpirit, this ſpiritual frame of heart, is of great price in the ſight of God. God values it above the world, and therefore who would not covet it more than the world, yea more than life it ſelf? Certainly the great God ſets a great price upon nothing but that which is of an invaluable price; what ſtretching, ſtrugling and ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is there for thoſe things that the great ones of the earth do high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170508:77"/> prize? Ah what ſtretching of wits, intereſts, and conſciences is there this day, to gain and hold up that which juſtice will caſt down? how much better would it bee if all perſons would in good earneſt ſtruggle and ſtrive, even as for life, after a quiet and ſilent ſpirit, which the great and glorious God ſets ſo great a price upon? this is a pearl of greateſt price, and happy is hee that purchaſes it, though it were with the loſs of all. But</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Conſider, that if you ſit not quiet and ſilent under your greateſt troubles, and your ſoreſt trials, you will bee found fighters againſt your own prayers. How often have you prayed that the will of God may bee done, yea, that it may bee done on the earth as the Angels (thoſe gliſtering Courtiers,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 10</note> thoſe Princes of glory) do it now in Heaven? when troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions come upon you, the will of God is done, his will is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, why then ſhould you fret,
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:170508:78"/> fling, and fume, and not rather quietly lye down in his will, whoſe<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Voluntas Dei neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitas rei,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſoul ſhould ſay <hi>Amen</hi> to Gods <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men;</hi> hee ſhould put his <hi>fiat,</hi> his <hi>placet,</hi> to Gods, go it never ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the hair with him.</note> will is a perfect will, a juſt and righteous will, a wiſe will, an o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-ruling will, an infinite will, a ſoveraign will, a holy will, an immutable will, an uncontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able will, an omnipotent will, and an eternal will; certainly you will but add affliction to affliction, by fighting againſt your own prayers, and by vexing and fretting your ſelves when the will of God is done; it is ſad to ſee a man to fight againſt his friends, it is ſadder to ſee him fight againſt his relations, it is ſaddeſt of all to ſee him fight againſt his prayers, and yet this every Chriſtian doth, who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mures and mutters when the Rod of God is upon him; ſome there be that pray againſt their prayers, as <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> who prayed for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency, with a <hi>proviſo,</hi> Lord give mee continency, but not yet; And ſome there bee who fight a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their prayers, as thoſe who pray that the will of God may be
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170508:78"/> done, and yet when his will is done upon them, they are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, they are ſtill fretting againſt the Lord. Ah Chriſtians! have you not ſins to fight againſt, and temptations to fight againſt, and a Devil to fight againſt yea a whole world to fight againſt? why then ſhould you bee found fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt your own prayers? But</p>
               <p>Seventhly, Conſider, A holy Silence under the heavieſt bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, the greateſt afflictions, the ſaddeſt providences and changes, will make all tollerable, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie to a Chriſtian; the ſilent ſoul can bear a burden without a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; thoſe burdens and troubles that will break a froward mans<note place="margin">Micah 7. 7, 8, 9, 10 Pſal. 62. 1,—6</note> back, will not ſo much as break a ſilent mans ſleep; thoſe afflictions that lye as heavy weights upon a murmurer, will lye as light as a feather upon a mute Chriſtian; that bed of ſorrow, which is as a bed of thorns to a fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>tful ſoul, will
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170508:79"/> bee as a bed of down to a ſilent ſoul; a holy Silence unſtings every affliction, it takes off the weight of every burden, it adds ſweet to every bitter, it changes dark nights into Sunſhiny daies, and terrible ſtorms into deſirable calms; the ſmalleſt ſufferings will eaſily vanquiſh an unquiet ſpirit, but a quiet ſpirit will as eaſily triumph over the greateſt ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. As little mercies are great mercies, ſo great ſufferings are but little ſufferings in the eye of a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſoul; the ſilent ſoul never complains that his affliction is too great, his burthen too heavy, his croſs too weighty, his ſufferings too many; Silence makes him victorious over all; And therefore as ever you would have heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions light, and bee able to bear a burthen without a burthen, labour as for life after this holy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. But</p>
               <p>Eighthly, Conſider, That a holy Silence under afflictions will
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:170508:79"/> bee your beſt armour of proof againſt thoſe temptations that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions may expoſe you to; times<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 31,—34. Job 1. 3 Zach. 1. 2, 3, 4 Mat. 4. 1, 2, 3</note> of afflictions, often prove times of great temptation; and therefore afflictions are called temptations, <hi>James 1. 12.

As in the firſt Chaos, there were the ſeeds of all creatures: ſo in the murmurers heart, there is not onely the ſeed of all ſin, but a lively operation of all ſin; ſin is become mighty in the hearts of murmurers, and none but an Almighty God can root it out; thoſe roots of bitterneſs have ſo ſpread and ſtrengthened them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the hearts of murmurers,<note place="margin">Iſa. 26. 4</note> that everlaſting ſtrength muſt put in, or they will bee undone for ever.

A murmurer is an ungodly man, hee is an ungodlike man, no man on earth more unlike to God, than the murmurer; and therefore no wonder if when Chriſt comes to execute judgement, hee deals ſo ſeverely and terribly with him. In the wars of <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> one having found a great pot of Gold that was hid in the earth, hee brought it to <hi>Tamberlain,</hi> who ask<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whether it had his Fathers ſtamp upon it, but when hee ſaw it had not his Fathers ſtamp, but the <hi>Roman</hi> ſtamp upon it, he would not own it, but caſt it away. The Lord Jeſus, when hee ſhall come

Ah ſouls! ſouls, as you would not go up and down this world with a badge of ungodli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs upon you, take heed of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring.</p>

As the River <hi>Nilus</hi> bringeth forth many Crocodiles, and the Scorpion many Serpents at one birth, ſo murmuring is a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170508:88"/> ſin that breeds and brings forth many ſins at once: Murmuring is like the Monſter <hi>Hydra,</hi> cut off one head, and many will riſe up in its room. Oh! therefore bend all thy ſtrength againſt this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſin; As the King of <hi>Syria</hi> ſaid<note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 31.</note> to his Captains, <hi>Fight neither with ſmall nor great, but with the King of Iſrael:</hi> So ſay I, fight not ſo much againſt this ſin or that, but fight againſt your murmuring, which is a Mother ſin; make uſe of all your<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 10, 11.</note> Chriſtian armour, make uſe of all the ammunition of Heaven, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the Mother, and in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her, you will deſtroy the daughters. When <hi>Goliah</hi> was ſlain, the Philiſtians fled; when a General in an Army is cut off, the common ſouldiers are eaſily and quickly routed and deſtroyed: So, deſtroy but murmuring, and you will quickly deſtroy diſobedience, ingratitude, impatience, diſtruſt, &amp;c. Oh! kill this Mother ſin, that this may never kill thy ſoul. I have read of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> that after
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170508:88"/> his Army was deſtroyed by an Angel, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. and hee returned home to his own Country, hee enquired of one about him, what hee thought the reaſon might bee why God ſo favoured the Jews, hee anſwered, that there was one <hi>Abraham</hi> their Father that was willing to ſacrifice his Son to death at the command of God, and that ever ſince that time God fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured that people: well, ſaid <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib,</hi> if that bee it, I have two Sons, and I will ſacrifice them both to death, if that will procure their God to favour mee; which when his two Sons heard, they (as the ſtory goeth) ſlew their Father, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 37. 38. chuſing rather to kill, than bee killed: So do thou, chuſe rather to kill this Mother ſin, than<note place="margin">Pſal. 137. 8, 9</note> to bee killed by it, or by any of thoſe vipers that are brought forth by it.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Conſider, That mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a God-provoking ſin; it is a ſin that provokes God, not

But</p>
               <p>Sixthly, Conſider, That mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a mercy-imbittering ſin, a mercy-ſouring ſin. As put the ſweeteſt things into a ſoure veſſel, it ſoures them, or put them into a bitter veſſel, and it imbitters them; murmuring puts gall and wormwood into every cup of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that God gives into our hands. As holy ſilence gives a ſweet taſte, a delightful relliſh to all a mans mercies; ſo murmuring imbitters all; the murmurer can taſte no ſweetneſs in his ſweeteſt morſels, every mercy, every morſel taſtes<note place="margin">Job 6. 6.</note> like the white of an Egge to him; this mercy, ſaith the murmurer, is not toothſome, nor that mercy is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170508:91"/> not wholeſome; here is a mercy wants ſalt, and there is a mercy wants ſauce. A murmurer can taſte no ſweet, hee can feel no comfort, hee can take no delight in any mercy hee injoyes. The murmurer writes <hi>Marah,</hi> that is, bitterneſs upon all his mercies, and hee reads and taſtes bitterneſs in all his mercies. All the murmurers Grapes, are Grapes of Gall, and all their cluſters are bitter, <hi>Deut. 32. 32. As to the hungry ſoul, every</hi>

               <p>Seventhly, Conſider, That mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a mercy-deſtroying ſin, a mercy-murthering ſin; murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuts the throat of mercy, it ſtabs all our mercies at the heart, it ſets all a mans mercies a bleeding about him at once, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 30.

As you love your mercies, as you would have the ſweet of your mercies, and as you would enjoy the life of your mercies, take heed of murmuring; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring will bring a conſumption upon your mercies, it is a worm that will make all your mercies to wither. As there bee ſome that

                  <p>I have read of a Noble man, whoſe Son and Heir was ſuppoſed to bee bewitched, and being ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed to go to ſome wizard or cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning man (as they are called) to have ſome help for his Son, that

I had rather the Witch ſhould have my Son, than the Devil; his Son ſhould ſuffer, rather than hee would ſin him out of his ſufferings. Hee that will not break the hedge of a fair Command, to avoid the foul way of ſome heavy affliction, may well conclude, that his af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is in love. Chriſtians! what ſay you when you are in the Mount, do you thus beſpeak the Lord?

When <hi>Paul</hi> would wiſh his dear Son <hi>Timothy</hi> the beſt mercy in all the world, the greateſt mercy in all the world, the moſt comprehenſive mercy in all the world, a mercy that carries the virtue, value and ſweetneſs of all mercies in it, hee wiſhes the preſence of God with his ſpirit, 2 <hi>Tim. 4. 22.

Now, when the inward man gains new ſtrength by every new trouble, when as troubles, preſſures, afflictions, and tribula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are increaſed, a Chriſtians inward ſtrength is increaſed alſo, then his afflictions are in love; when the preſence of God is with our inward man, chearing, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forting, encouraging, ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and renewing of that, wee may ſafely conclude, that all theſe
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:170508:101"/> trials, though they are never ſo ſharp and ſmart, yet they are in love.</p>
                  <p>I have read of a company of poor Chriſtians that were baniſhed into ſome remote parts, and one ſtanding by, ſeeing them paſs a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, ſaid, That it was a very ſad condition thoſe poor people were in, to bee thus hurried from the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety of men; and to bee made companions with the beaſts of the field; true ſaid another, it were a ſad condition indeed, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="188" facs="tcp:170508:108"/> If God did not ſtrike thee in that mercy, which was near and dear unto thee, it would not amount to an affliction; that is not worthy the name of an affliction, that doth not ſtrike at ſome boſome mercy; that trouble is no trouble, that doth not touch ſome choice contentment; that ſtorm is no ſtorm, that onely blows off the leaves, but never hurts the fruit; that thruſt is no thruſt, that onely touches the cloaths, but never reaches the skin; that cut is no cut, that onely cuts the hatt, but never touches the head; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is that affliction any afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that onely reaches ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote enjoyment, but never reaches a <hi>Joſeph</hi> a <hi>Benjamin,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The beſt mercy is not too good for the beſt God; the beſt of the beſt, is not good enough for him who is goodneſs it ſelf; the beſt childe, the beſt yoak-fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the beſt friend, the beſt Jewel in all thy Crown muſt bee

Mal. 1. 13, 14.</note> there is no mercy, no enjoyment, no contentment worthy of God, but the beſt; the milk of mercy is for others, the cream of mercy is due to God; the choiceſt, the fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, and the ſweeteſt flowers, are fitteſt for the boſome of God; if hee will take the beſt flower in all thy garden, and plant it in a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſoil, haſt thou any cauſe to murmure? wilt thou not hold thy peace?</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Your near and dear mercies were firſt the Lords, before they were yours, and alwaies the Lords more than they were yours; when God gives a mercy, hee doth not relinquiſh his own right in that mercy, 1 <hi>Chron. 29. 14. All things come of thee, and of thine own have wee given thee.</hi> The ſweet of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy is yours, but the ſovereign right to diſpoſe of your mercies is the Lords. <hi>Quicquid es, debes crean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, quicquid potes, debes redimenti. Bern.</hi> Whatſoever thou art, thou
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:170508:109"/> oweſt to him that made thee; and whatſoever thou haſt, thou oweſt to him that redeemed thee. You ſay it is but juſt and reaſonable that men ſhould do with their own as they pleaſe, and is it not juſt and reaſonable, that God, who is Lord Paramount, ſhould do with his own as hee pleaſes? doſt thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeve that the great God may do in Heaven what hee pleaſes, and on the Seas what hee pleaſes, and in the Nations and Kingdomes of the world what hee pleaſes, and in thy heart what hee pleaſes? and doſt thou not beleeve that God may do in thy houſe what hee pleaſes, and do with thy mercies what hee pleaſes? <hi>Job 9. 12.

It was once the ſaying of <hi>Pompey,</hi> that with one ſtamp of his foot hee could

But</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, It may bee thou haſt not made a happy improvement of thy near and dear mercies whilſt thou injoyeſt them: thou haſt been taken with thy mercies, but thy heart hath not been taken up in the improvement of them; there are many who are very much taken with their mercies, who make no conſcience of improving their mercies; have thy near and dear mercies been a ſtar to lead thee
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170508:110"/> to Chriſt? have they been a cloud by day, and a pillar of light by night to lead thee towards the heavenly <hi>Canaan?</hi> have they been a <hi>Jacobs</hi> Ladder to thy ſoul? haſt thou by them been provoked to give up thy ſelf to God as a living<note place="margin">Rom. 12. 1</note> Sacrifice? haſt thou improved thy near and dear mercies to the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flaming of thy love to God? to the ſtrengthening of thy confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in God? to the raiſing of thy communion with God? and to the engaging of thy heart to a more cloſe and circumſpect walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before God? &amp;c. if thou haſt not thus improved them, thou haſt more cauſe to bee mute, than to murmure, to bee ſilent, than to be impatient, to fall out with thy ſelf, than to fall out with thy God.

                     <hi>Pliny</hi> ſpeaks of one <hi>Creſſinus,</hi> who<note place="margin">Lib. 18. cap. 6.</note> improved a little peece of ground to a far greater advantage, than his neighbours could a greater quanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of land, thereupon hee was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed of witch-craft, but hee to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend himſelf, brought into the Court his ſervants, and their working-tools, and ſaid, <hi>Veneficia mea Quirites haec ſunt,</hi> theſe are my witch-crafts (O yee <hi>Romans</hi>) theſe ſervants, and theſe working<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tools, are all the witch-craft that I know of; when the people heard this plea, with one conſent they acquitted him, and declared him not guilty; and ſo his little peece of ground was ſecured to him; there is no way to ſecure your mercies, but by improving of them, there is nothing that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vokes God to ſtrip you of your mercies, like the non-improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them, <hi>Matth. 25. 24,—31. Take therefore the talent from him,

                  <p>Fifthly, If in this caſe God had made thee a preſident to others, thou muſt have held thy peace, how much more then ſhouldſt thou bee mute when God hath made many others preſidents to thee?

                  <p>Though God hath ſmitten thee in this or that near and dear en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment, it is thy wiſdome to hold thy peace; for that God that hath taken away one, might have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away all.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Anytus</hi> a young ſpark of <hi>Athens,</hi> came revelling into <hi>Alcibiades</hi> houſe, and as hee ſate at ſupper with ſome ſtrangers, hee roſe on a ſudden, and took away one half

                  <p>Sixthly, It may bee thy ſins have been much about thy near and dear injoyments; it may bee thou haſt over-loved them, and over-prized them, and over-much delighted thy

The ſweeteſt comforts of this life, they are but like treaſures of Snow; now do but take a handful of Snow, and cruſh it in your hands, and it will melt away preſently, but if you let it lye upon the ground, it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue for ſome time; and ſo it is with the contentments of this world, if you graſp them in your hands, and lay them too near your hearts, they will quickly melt and vaniſh away, but if you will not hold them too faſt in your hands, nor lay them too cloſe to your hearts, they will abide the
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:170508:114"/> longer with you. There are thoſe that love their mercies into their graves, that hug their mercies to death, that kiſs them, till they kill them: Many a man hath ſlain his mercies, by ſetting too great a value upon them; many a man hath <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Now, if God hath ſtript thee of that very mercy with which thou haſt often com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted ſpiritual Adultery, and Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latry, haſt thou any cauſe to mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure? haſt thou not rather cauſe to hold thy peace, and to be mute

                     </note> ſomething elſe that may bee bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for thee, and hee will certainly make up thy loſs, either in kinde, or in worth; hee took from <hi>David</hi> an <hi>Abſalom,</hi> and hee gave him a <hi>Solomon,</hi> hee took from him a <hi>Michal,</hi> and gave him a wiſe <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bigail,</hi> hee took from <hi>Job</hi> ſeven ſons<note place="margin">The firſt and laſt chapters of Job com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared.

I have read of a godly man, who living near a Philoſopher, did of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten perſwade him to become a Chriſtian: Oh but ſaid the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher! I muſt, or may loſe all for Chriſt; to which the good man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, if you loſe any thing for Chriſt, hee will bee ſure to repay it a hundred fold; I but ſaid the Philoſopher, will you bee bound for Chriſt, that if he do not pay mee, you will? yes that I will, ſaid the good man: So the Philoſopher be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a Chriſtian, and the good man entred into bond for perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of covenants; ſometime af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it happened that the Philoſopher
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:170508:118"/> fell ſick on his death-bed, and hold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bond in his hand, ſent for the party engaged, to whom hee gave up the bond, and ſaid, Chriſt hath paid all, there is nothing for you to pay, take your bond and cancel it. Chriſt will ſuffer none of his children to go by the loſs; he hath all, and hee will make up all to them; in the cloſe Chriſt will pay the reckoning; no man ſhall ever have cauſe to ſay, that hee hath been a loſer by Chriſt; and therefore thou haſt much cauſe to bee mute, thou haſt no cauſe to murmure, though God hath ſnatch'd the faireſt and the ſweeteſt flower out of thy boſome.</p>
                  <p>Tenthly, How canſt thou tell, but that that which thou calleſt a near and dear mercy, if it had been<note place="margin">The La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of Jeremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah are a full proof of this.</note> continued longer to thee, might have proved the greateſt croſs, the greateſt calamity and miſery that ever thou didſt meet with in this world? Our mercies like choice Wines, many times turn into Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negar;
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:170508:119"/> our faireſt hopes are often blaſted, and that very mercy which wee ſometimes have ſaid ſhould be a ſtaff to ſupport us, hath proved a ſword to peirce us; how often have our moſt flouriſhing mercies wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered in our hands? and our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome-contentments been turned in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to gall and wormwood? If God had<note place="margin">2 Sam. 12. 16.</note> continued the life of <hi>Davids</hi> childe to him, it would have been but a living Monument of his ſin and ſhame, and all that knew the childe would have pointed at him, yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der goes <hi>Davids</hi> baſtard, and ſo<note place="margin">This age affords many ſad inſtances of this na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; who can think of <hi>Tiburn,</hi> &amp; queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it? and of killing &amp; drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſay, how can this bee?</note> have kept <hi>Davids</hi> wound ſtill a bleeding; many Parents who have ſought the lives of their children with tears, have lived afterwards to ſee them take ſuch courſes, and come to ſuch diſmal ends, as have brought their gray-hairs with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to their graves. It had been ten thouſand times a greater mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to many Parents to have buried their children, as ſoon as ever they had been born, than to ſee them come to ſuch unhappy ends as they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:170508:119"/> often do. Well Chriſtian! it may bee the Lord hath taken from thee ſuch a hopeful ſon, or ſuch a dear daughter, and thou ſayeſt how can I hold my peace, but heark Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, heark, canſt thou tell mee how long thou muſt have travelled in birth again with them before they had been born again, before they had been twice born? would not every ſin that they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted againſt thy gracious God, cauſe a new throw in thy ſoul? would not every temptation that they had fallen before, been as a dagger at thy heart? would not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very affliction that ſhould have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallen them, been as a knife at thy throat? what are thoſe pains, and pangs; and throws of child-birth, to thoſe after pains, pangs and throws that might have been brought up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee by the ſins and ſufferings of thy children? Well Chriſtians, hold your peace, for you do not know what thorns in your eyes, what goads in your ſides, nor what ſpears in your hearts, ſuch
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:170508:120"/> near and dear mercies might have proved, had they been longer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued.</p>
                  <p>Eleventhly, Thou canſt not tell how bad thy heart might have<note place="margin">Deut. 32. <hi>ult.</hi> 5. to the end. Jer. 5. 7, 8, 9. ch. 2. 31. &amp; ch. 22. 21.

                  <p>I have read of the Pine-tree, that if the bark bee pulled off, it will laſt a long time, but if it continue long on, it rots the tree. Ah! how
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:170508:120"/> bad, how rotten, how baſe would many have proved, had not God pulled off their bark of health, wealth, friendſhip, &amp;c? near and dear relations they ſtick as cloſe to us as the bark of a tree ſticks to the tree, and if God ſhould not pull off this bark, how apt ſhould wee be to rot and corrupt our ſelves? there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God is fain to bark us, and peel us, and ſtrip us naked, and bare of our deareſt enjoyments, and ſweeteſt contentments, that ſo our ſouls, like the Pine-tree, may proſper and thrive the better; who can ſeriouſly conſider of this, and not hold his peace, even then when God takes a Jewel out of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome? Heap all the ſweeteſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments, and moſt deſirable enjoyments of this world upon a man, they will not make him a Chriſtian; heap them upon a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian, they will not make him a better Chriſtian; many a Chriſtian hath been made worſe by the good things of this world, but where is the Chriſtian that hath been better<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:170508:121"/> by them? therefore bee quiet when God ſtrips thee of them.</p>
                  <p>Twelfthly and laſtly, Get thy heart more affected with ſpiritual loſſes, and then thy ſoul will bee leſs afflicted with thoſe temporal loſſes that thou mourneſt under: Haſt thou loſt nothing of that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>To this I anſwer, Firſt, Thou canſt not date thy affliction from the firſt day of thy pollution; thou haſt been polluted from the womb, but thou haſt not been af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted from the womb; many have<note place="margin">Pſal. 51. 5 Rom. 5. 12</note> been the daies, the years ſince thou waſt born in ſin, few have been the daies, the years that thou haſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced ſorrow; thou canſt not eaſily number the daies of thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, thou canſt eaſily number the daies of thy ſuffering; thou canſt not number thy daies of mercy, thou canſt eaſily number thy daies of calamity; thou canſt not num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thy daies of health, but thou canſt eaſily tell over thy daies of ſickneſs.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, Thy afflictions are not ſo long as the afflictions of other
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:170508:123"/> Saints; compare thy winter nights and other Saints winter nights to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; thy ſtorms and troubles, and other Saints ſtorms and troubles together, thy loſſes and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<note place="margin">Pſalms 77, &amp; 88.

And another dieth in the bitterneſs of his ſoul, and never eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with pleaſure.</hi> There are thoſe that have never a good day all their daies, who have not a day of reſt among all their daies of trouble, not a day of health among all their daies of ſickneſs, nor a day of gladneſs among all their daies of ſadneſs, nor a day of ſtrength among all their daies of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, nor a day of honour among
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:170508:123"/> all their daies of reproach, whoſe whole life is one continued winters night, who every day drink gall and wormwood, who lye down ſighing, who riſe groaning, and who ſpend their daies in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining, no ſorrow to our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, no ſufferings to our ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; ſome there bee who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tears in their eyes, ſorrows in their hearts, rods on their backs, and croſſes in their hands, but it is not ſo with thee, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bee ſilent.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The longer thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction hath been, the ſweeter will Heaven bee to thee at laſt; the<note place="margin">Pſal. 126. 1, 2, 5, 6. compared.</note> longer the Iſraelites had been in the wilderneſs, the ſweeter was <hi>Canaan</hi> to them at laſt; the longer the ſtorm, the ſweeter the calm; the longer the winter nights, the ſweeter the ſummer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> daies; long af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions will much ſet off the glory of Heaven; the harbour is moſt ſweet and deſirable to them that have been long toſſed upon
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:170508:124"/> the Seas: So will Heaven bee to thoſe who have been long in a Sea of troubles. The new Wine of Chriſts Kingdome is moſt ſweet to<note place="margin">Luk. 22. 18</note> thoſe that have been long a drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of gall and vinegar, the Crown of glory will bee moſt delightful to them, who have been long in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating with the world, the fleſh, and the devil. The longer our Journey is, the ſweeter will be our end; and the longer our paſſage is, the ſweeter will our Haven be; the higher the mountain, the glad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der wee ſhall bee when wee are got to the top of it; the longer the heir is kept from his inheritance, the more delight hee will have when hee comes to poſſeſs it.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, They are not long, but ſhort, if compared to that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of glory that is reſerved for the Saints, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. 16, 17, 18. If you turn to the words, you ſhall<note place="margin">See this largely o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in my String of Pearls.</note> finde for affliction glory, for light afflictions, a weight of glory, and for ſhort momentany afflictions, eternal
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:170508:124"/> glory; there will quickly be an end of thy ſadneſſe, but there will never be an end of thy happineſs; there will ſoon bee an end of thy calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and miſery, there will never be and end of thy felicity and glory; the Kingdomes of this world are not<note place="margin">Pſal. 45. &amp; 72. &amp; 89.

There were ſeven ſorts of Crowns that were that were in uſe among the <hi>Roman</hi> Victors, but they were all fading and periſhing; but the Crown of glory that at laſt God will ſet upon the heads of his Saints, ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue as long as God himſelf con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues. Who can look upon thoſe eternal Manſions that are above, and thoſe everlaſting pleaſures that bee at Gods right hand, and ſay, that his affliction is long? Well Chriſtian, let thy afflictions be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo long, yet one hours being in the boſome of Chriſt, will make thee forget both the length and
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170508:125"/> ſtrength of all thy afflictions.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, The longer you have been afflicted, the more in ſpiritual experiences you have been enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 5. For as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion alſo aboundeth by Christ.</hi> The lower the ebbe, the higher the tide, the more pain, the more gain, the more afflicted, the more comforted, the lower wee are caſt, the higher we ſhall bee raiſed. Of all Chriſtians, none ſo rich in ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual experiences, as thoſe that have<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 11 2 Cor. 12. 9 Job 33. 17,—22</note> been long in the ſchool of affliction. Oh the bleſſed ſtories that ſuch can tell of the power of God ſupport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, of the wiſdome of God directing them, of the favour of God comforting them, of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God aſſiſting them! Oh the love-tokens, the love-letters, the bracelets, the Jewels, that they are able to produce ſince they have been in the furnace of affliction! Oh the ſins that long afflictions have diſcovered and mortified! O the

The men of this world will with much quietneſs and calmneſs of ſpirit, bear much, and ſuffer much, I and ſuffer long, when they finde their ſufferings to add to their revenues: and ſhall nature do more than grace?

                  <p>Sixthly, Long afflictions ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times are but preparatives to long liv'd mercies; <hi>Joſephs</hi> thirteen years impriſonment, was but a prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to fourſcore years reigning like a King; <hi>Davids</hi> ſeven years baniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, was but a preparative to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years reigning in much honour and glory; <hi>Jobs</hi> long afflictions were but preparatives to more long-lived mercies, as you may ſee in that laſt of <hi>Job;</hi> and thoſe ſad and ſore trials that the Jews have been

Now, the more grace here, the more glory hereafter; the higher in grace, the higher in glory.

A Chriſtian is never ſo frequent, ſo fervent, ſo abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant in the work of the Lord, as when hee is afflicted, <hi>Iſa. 26. 16. Lord, in trouble have they viſited thee, they poured out a prayer when

                  <p>It is an excellent obſervation of <hi>Calvin</hi> upon Gods rewarding the <hi>Rechabites</hi> obedience, <hi>Jer.</hi> 35. 19. God (ſaith hee) oft recompenceth the ſhadows and ſeeming appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances of virtue, to ſhew what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency hee takes in the ample re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hee hath reſerved for true and ſincere piety. Now, if the longer a Chriſtian is afflicted, the more his religious ſervices will bee multiplied, and the more they are multiplied, the more his glory at laſt will bee encreaſed, then, the longer a Saint is afflicted on earth, the more glory he ſhall have when hee comes to Heaven. But</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, The longer any Saint is afflicted, the more into the image and likeneſs of Chriſt hee will bee transformed: It is one of<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28, 29, &amp;c. 2 Cor. 1 5, 6, 7 Phil. 3. 10 Heb. 2. 10 2 Tim. 2. 12.</note> Gods great deſigns and ends in af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of his people, to make them more conformable to his Son, and God will not loſe his end; men of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten loſe theirs, but God never hath, nor will loſe his, and experience
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:170508:129"/> tells us, that God doth every day by afflictions accompliſh this end upon his people; the longer they are afflicted, the more they are made conformable to Chriſt, in meekneſs, lowlineſs, ſpiritualneſs, heavenlineſs, in faith, love, ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, pitty, compaſſion, &amp;c. Now certainly, the more like to Chriſt, the more beloved of Chriſt; the more a Chriſtian is like to Chriſt, the more hee is the delight of Chriſt; and the more like to Chriſt on earth, the nearer the ſoul ſhall ſit to Chriſt in Heaven; nothing makes a man more conformable to Chriſt than afflictions. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> (in his ſecond Apology for the Chriſtians) hath obſerved, that there is ſcarce any prediction or prophecy concerning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Chriſt the Son of God to bee made man, but the Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (who were all after <hi>Moſes</hi>) did from thence invent ſome fable, and feign it to have been acted by ſome one or other of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Sons, onely the Prophecies about the croſs of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:170508:130"/> Chriſt, they have taken for the ground of no fable, they have not among all their fictions told us of any one of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Sons that was crucified, that acted his part upon the croſs; many would wear the Crown with Chriſt, that do not care for bearing the croſs with Chriſt. But</p>
                  <p>Eighthly, The longer they have been, the greater cauſe thou haſt to bee ſilent and patient, for impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will but lengthen out the day of thy ſorrows; every impatient act adds one link more to the chain, every act of frowardneſs adds one laſh more to thoſe that have already been laid on, every act of muttering will but add ſtroak to ſtroak, and ſting to ſting; every act of murmuring will but add bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to burden, and ſtorm to ſtorm; the moſt compendious way to lengthen out thy long afflictions, is to fret, and vex, and murmure un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them; as thou wouldeſt ſee a ſpeedy iſſue of thy long afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,

                  <p>Ninthly, Gods time is the beſt time; mercy is never nearer; ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is at hand, deliverance is at the<note place="margin">Act. 27. 13,—<hi>ult.</hi>

The Phyſicians time is the beſt time for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to have eaſe; the impatient patient cryes out to his Phyſician, Oh Sir! a little eaſe, a little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment; Oh the pains, the tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments that I am under! Oh Sir!

                  <p>Tenthly and laſtly, They ſhall laſt no longer than there is need, and then they ſhall work for thy good; it is with ſouls as it is with bodies, ſome bodies are more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily and more ſuddenly cured than others are, and ſo are ſome ſouls; God will not ſuffer the plaiſter to lye one day, no not one hour, no not a moment longer than there is need; ſome fleſh heals quickly, proud fleſh is long a healing; by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction God quickly heals ſome,

If need bee yee are in heavineſs through manifold temptations,</hi> or through various afflictions; the burden ſhall lye no longer upon thee than needs muſt, thy pain ſhall endure no longer than needs muſt, thy phyſick ſhall make thee no longer ſick than needs muſt, &amp;c. thy heavenly Father is a Phyſician as wiſe as hee is loving; when thy heart begins to grow high, hee ſees there is need of ſome heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction to bring it low; when thy heart grows cold, hee ſees there is need of ſome fiery affliction to heal it and warm it; when thy heart grows dull and dead, hee ſees there is need of ſome ſmart affliction to enliven and quicken it. And as thy afflictions ſhall continue no longer than there is need, ſo they ſhall laſt no longer than they ſhall work for thy good; if all along they ſhall work for thy good, thou haſt no cauſe to complain that thy afflictions are long: that they ſhall thus work, I have fully proved in

                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, If thy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are ſo great, then what madneſs and folly will it bee for thee to make them greater by mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring?

                  <p>Secondly, It may bee thou art under ſome preſent diſtemper that diſ-inables thee to make a right judgement of the different dealings<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 28. Good men are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſtrangely beſotted, and infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated.</note> of God with thy ſelf and others: When the mind is diſtempered, and the brain troubled, many things ſeem to bee that are not, and then little things ſeem very great.

The ſupplicant woman appealed from drunken King <hi>Philip,</hi> to ſober King <hi>Philip;</hi> it is good to appeal from a diſtempered mind, to a clear compoſed mind, for that is the way to make a righteous judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all the righteous diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, both towards our ſelves, and towards others.<note place="margin">Nothing but ſtrong vomits, ſtrong purges, ſtrong gliſters will cure ſome.</note>

                  <p>Fourthly, Though thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are greater than this and that particular mans afflictions, yet doubtleſs there are many thouſands in the world, whoſe afflictions are greater than thine: Canſt thou ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly conſider the ſore calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miſeries that the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſword hath brought upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand Chriſtians in forein parts, and ſay that thy afflictions are greater than theirs? ſurely no.<note place="margin">Lib. 8 cap. 21.</note>

But</p>
                  <p>Fifthly, As thy afflictions are greater than other mens, ſo it may bee thy mercies are greater than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170508:143"/> mens mercies, and if ſo, thou haſt no cauſe but to hold thy peace; as <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions were greater than other mens, ſo his mercies were greater that other<note place="margin">Job 1</note> mens; and <hi>Job</hi> wiſely ſets one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt another, and then laies his hand upon his mouth.

But</p>
                  <p>Sixthly and laſtly, By great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions the Lord may greaten thy graces, and greaten thy name and<note place="margin">James 5. 10, 11</note> fame in the world; by <hi>Jobs</hi> great

Certainly, if thou art dear to Chriſt, hee will greaten thee in ſpirituals, by all the great afflictions that are upon thee; hee will raiſe thy faith, and inflame thy love, and quicken thy hope, and brighten thy zeal, and perfect thy patience, and perfume thy name, and make it<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1 Eccleſ. 7. 1</note> like a precious ointment, like a preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Secondly, Temptations reſiſted &amp; bewailed, will never hurt you, nor harm you; diſtaſted temptations ſeldome or never prevail, ſo long as the ſoul diſtaſtes them, and the will remains firmly averſe againſt them, they can do no hurt; ſo

Satans malice to tempt is no ſufficient ground for a Chriſtian to diſpute Gods love up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, if it were, there is no Saint on earth that ſhould quietly poſſeſs di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine favour, a week, a day, an hour.

Men hate not the picture of a Toad, the Wolf flies not up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a painted Sheep; no more doth Satan upon thoſe he hath in chains; therefore hold thy peace, though thou art inwardly tempted, as

                  <p>Fourthly, Whilſt Satan is temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 34 1 John 2. 1, 2 Zach. 3. 1, 2, 3</note> of thee, Chriſt in the Court of glory is interceding for thee, <hi>Luk. 22. 31, 32. And the Lord ſaid, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have you, that hee may ſift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> Satan would fain have been ſhaking of him up and down, as wheat is ſhaken in a fan, but Chriſts interceſſion fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates Satans deſigned temptations: when ever Satan ſtands at our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows to tempt us, Chriſt ſtands at his Fathers to intercede for us, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. Hee ever lives to make interceſſion.</hi> Some of the learned think, that Chriſt intercedes onely by virtue of his merits, others think that it is done onely with his mouth, probably it may bee done both waies, the rather becauſe hee hath a tongue (as alſo a whole glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body) in Heaven, and is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that that mouth which pleaded ſo much for us on earth, ſhould be<note place="margin">Joh. 17.</note>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:170508:147"/> altogether ſilent for us in Heaven? Chriſt is a perſon of higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, hee is the greateſt favourite in the Court of Heaven, hee al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies ſtands betwixt us and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, if there bee any evil plotted or deſigned againſt us by Satan (the great accuſer of the brethren) hee foreſees it, and by his interceſſion prevents it. When Satan puts in his pleas, and commences ſute upon ſute againſt us, Chriſt ſtill under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes our cauſe, hee anſwers all his pleas, and non-ſutes Satan at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn, and in deſpite of Hell hee keep us up in divine favour; when Satan pleads, Lord here are ſuch and ſuch ſins that thy children have committed, and here are ſuch and ſuch duties that they have omitted, and here are ſuch and ſuch mercies that they have not improved, and here are ſuch and ſuch ordinances that they have ſlighted, and here are ſuch and ſuch motions of the Spirit, that they have quenched: divine Juſtice, anſwers, All this is true; but Chriſt hath appeared on
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:170508:147"/> their behalf, hee hath pleaded their<note place="margin">Saith Chriſt, Lord, here is wiſdome for their folly, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility for their pride, heavenli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their earthli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs for their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, &amp;c.</note> cauſe, hee hath fully and fairly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered whatever hath been object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and given compleat ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to the utmoſt farthing: So that there is no accuſation nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation that can ſtand in force a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt them; upon which account the Apoſtle triumphs in that, <hi>Rom. 8. 34. Who is hee that condemneth? it is Chriſt that died, yea rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion for us.</hi> Chriſts interceſſion ſhould bee the ſouls Anchor-hold in time of temptation; in the day of thy temptation thou needeſt not be diſturbed nor diſquieted, but in peace and patience poſſeſs thine own ſoul, conſidering what a friend thou haſt in the Court of glory, and how hee is moſt active for thee, when Satan is moſt buſie in tempting of thee.</p>
                  <p>Fifthly and Laſtly, All temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that the Saints meet with, ſhall work much for their good,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170508:148"/> they ſhall bee much for their gain, the profit and advantage that will redound to tempted ſouls by all their temptations, is very great; now this will appear to bee a moſt<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28 Jam. 1. 12.</note> certain truth, by an induction of particulars, thus:</p>
                  <p>Firſt, By temptations God mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies and encreaſes his childrens ſpiritual experiences; the encreaſe of which is better than the encreaſe<note place="margin">Rom 5. 3, 4 Frequent engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments add to the ſouldiers skill, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe his experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> of gold; in the ſchool of temptation God gives his children the greateſt experience of his power ſupporting them, of his word comforting of them, of his mercy warming of them, of his wiſdome counſelling of them, of his faithfulneſs joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and of his grace ſtrengthening of them, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. My grace ſhall bee ſufficient for thee. Paul</hi> never experienced ſo deeply what Almighty power was, what the everlaſting arms of mercy were, and what infinite grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, as when hee was under the buffetings of Satan.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:170508:148"/>
                  <p>Secondly, All their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhall bee phyſical, their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations ſhall bee happy preventions of great abominations, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. Leſt I ſhould bee exalted, lest I</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Thoſe ſouldiers that are moſt in fighting, are leaſt in ſinning, and moſt free from diſeaſes.</note> 
                     <hi>ſhould bee exalted,</hi> it is twice in that one verſe, hee begins with it, and hee ends with it; if hee had not been buffeted, hee might have been more highly exalted in his own conceit, than hee was before in his exſtacie. Ah tempted ſouls! you ſay you are naught, very naught, but had it not been for the ſchool of temptation, you might have been ſtark naught before this time; you ſay you are ſick, you are even ſick to death, why your ſickneſſe had before this time killed you, had not temptations been phyſical to you; you are bad under temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but doubtleſs you would have been much worſe, had not God made temptation a diet-drink to you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Temptations ſhall much promote the exerciſe of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170508:149"/> grace, as the ſpring in the watch ſets all the wheels a going; and as <hi>Solomons</hi> virtuous woman ſet all her<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 10,—<hi>ult.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7</note> maidens to work: So temptation ſets faith on work, and love on work, and repentance on work, and hope on work, and holy fear on work, and godly ſorrow on work.<note place="margin">Tapers burn clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt in the dark.</note> As the wind ſets the Mill at work, ſo the wind of temptation ſets the graces of the Saints a going; now faith runs to Chriſt, now it hugs a promiſe, now it pleads the blood of Chriſt, now it looks to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, now it takes the ſword of the Spirit, &amp;c. now<note place="margin">Cant. 3. 6, 7</note> love cleaves to Chriſt, now love hangs upon Chriſt, now love will fight it out to the death for Chriſt, now hope flies to the horns of the Sanctuary, now hope puts on her helmet, now hope caſts her anchor upon that within the veil, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19</note> Grace is never more acted, than when a Chriſtian is moſt tempted. Satan made a bow of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife (of his Rib, as <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> ſpeaks) and ſhot a tentation by her at <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:170508:149"/> thinking to have ſhot him to the heart, <hi>curſe God and dye,</hi> but the activity of <hi>Jobs</hi> graces was a breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate that made him temptation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; the Devil tempting <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> told him hee was a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and therefore perſwaded him to drink in the preſent pleaſures of this life (for ſaith hee) thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the future joyes with God in Heaven (<hi>Bonaventures</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being active) hee anſwers, no, not ſo Satan, if I muſt not enjoy God after this life, let mee enjoy him as much as I can in this life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By temptations the Lord will make you the more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and uſefu to others; none ſo fit and able to relieve tempted<note place="margin">The skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuleſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are of greateſt ſervice and uſe to the ſouldiers.</note> ſouls, to ſympathize with tempted ſouls, to ſuccour tempted ſouls, to counſel tempted ſouls, to pitty tempted ſouls, to ſupport tempted ſouls, to bear with tempted ſouls, and to comfort tempted ſouls, as thoſe who have been in the ſchool
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170508:150"/> of temptations, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3, 4. Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed bee God, even the Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the God of all comfort; Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that wee may bee able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith wee our ſelves are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God.</hi> By temptations God trains up his ſervants, and fits and capacitates them to ſuccour and ſhelter their fellow brethren. One tempted Chriſtian, ſaith <hi>Luther,</hi> is<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luther</hi> in Gen. 27. Rev. 2. 24</note> more profitable and uſeful to other Chriſtians, than a hundred (I may add, than a thouſand) that have not known the depths of Satan, that have not been in the ſchool of temptation; hee that is Maſter of Arts in the ſchool of temptation, hath learned an Art to comfort, to ſuccour, and gently to handle tempted and diſtreſſed ſouls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond what all humane Arts can reach unto; no Doctor to him that hath been a Doctor in the ſchool of temptation, all other Doctors are but illiterate dunces to him.</p>
                  <pb n="273" facs="tcp:170508:150"/>
                  <p>Fifthly, It is an honour to the Saints to bee tempted, and in the iſſue to have an honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt ever the tempter; it was a great honour to <hi>David,</hi> that hee ſhould be put to fight hand to hand<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.</note> with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and in the iſſue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him; but it was a far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                     <note place="margin">Job 1. 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9, 10</note> that they ſhould bee put to combate in the open field with Satan him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and in the cloſe to gain a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous conqueſt over him, as they did; it was a very great honour to<note place="margin">2 Sam. 23. 13,—18.</note>

Where wee have the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb; but why the ſong of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and of the Lamb? but to hint this to us, that the overthrow of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> was a figure of the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of Satan, and the triumphal ſong of <hi>Moſes</hi> was a figure of that ſong which the Saints ſhall ſing for their overthrow of Satan. As cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly as <hi>Iſrael</hi> overcame <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> ſo certainly ſhall every true Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite overcome Satan. The <hi>Romans</hi> were worſted in many fights, but were never overcome in a ſet war, at the long run they overcame all their enemies; though a Chriſtian may bee worſted by Satan in ſome particular skirmiſhes, yet at the long run hee is ſure of an honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable conqueſt. God puts a great
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170508:152"/> deal of honour upon a poor ſoul, when hee brings him into the open field to ſight it ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> with Satan<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by fighting hee overcomes, hee gains the victory, hee triumphs over Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and leads captivity captive. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> gives this reaſon why God permitted <hi>Adam</hi> at firſt to be tempted, <hi>viz.</hi> that hee might have had the more glory in reſiſting and withſtanding Satans temptation; it is the glory of a Chriſtian to bee made ſtrong to reſiſt, and to have his reſiſtance crowned with a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py conqueſt.</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, By temptations the Lord will make his people more frequent and more abundant in the work of prayer; every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation proves a ſtrong alarm to prayer. When <hi>Paul</hi> was in the ſchool of temptation, hee prayed<note place="margin">2 Cor. 12. 8, 9</note> thrice, that is, often; daies of temptation, are daies of great ſupplication. Chriſtians uſually pray moſt, when they are tempted moſt; they are moſt buſie with
<pb n="277" facs="tcp:170508:152"/> God, when Satan is moſt buſie with them; a Chriſtian is moſt upon his knees, when Satan ſtands moſt at his elbow.</p>

                     </note> and a man much in prayer; holy prayer, ſaith hee, is a ſhelter to the ſoul, a ſacrifice to God, and a ſcourge to the Devil.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Luther</hi> was a man under mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold temptations, and a man much in prayer; hee is ſaid to have ſpent three hours every day in prayer, hee uſed to ſay, that prayer was the beſt book in his ſtudy.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chryſoſtome</hi> was much in the ſchool of temptation, and delighted much in prayer; Oh! ſaith hee, it is more bitter than death to bee ſpoiled of prayer, and hereupon (as hee obſerves) <hi>Daniel</hi> choſe rather to run the hazard of his life, than to loſe his prayer. But</p>
                  <p>Seventhly, By temptations the Lord will make his people more and more conformable to the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of his Son. Chriſt was much<note place="margin">Luk. 4,</note>

<pb n="279" facs="tcp:170508:153"/> makes ſin more hateful, and the world leſs delightful, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations leſs hurtful: by temptations God diſcovers to us our own weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the creatures inſufficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy<note place="margin">1 Pet. 5. 8</note> in the hour of temptation to help us, or ſuccour us; by temptations God will brighten our Chriſtian<note place="margin">Epheſ. 6. 10,—18</note> Armour, and make us ſtand more upon our Chriſtian watch, and keep us cloſer to a ſuccouring Chriſt; by temptations the Lord will make his ordinances to bee more highly prized, and Heaven to be more earneſtly deſired.

                     <hi>Geographers</hi> write, that the City of <hi>Syracuſe</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> is ſo curiouſly ſituated, that the Sun is never out of ſight: though the children of God ſometimes are under ſome clouds of afflictions, yet the Sun of Mercy, the Sun of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, is never quite out of ſight.

                  <p>Thirdly, Though God hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken thee, yet his love abides and continues conſtant to thee; hee loves thee with an everlaſting love, <hi>Jer. 31. 3. Where hee loves, hee loves to the end,</hi> John 13. 1. <hi>Iſa. 49. 14, 15, 16. But Zion ſaid, the Lord hath forſaken mee, and my Lord hath for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten mee.

As <hi>Joſephs</hi> heart was full of love to his brethren, even then when hee<note place="margin">Gen. 42.</note>

When God<note place="margin">Mal. 3. 6.</note> puts the blackeſt veil of all upon his face, yet then his heart is full of love to his people, then his bowels are yearning towards them, <hi>Jer. 31. 18, 19, 20. Is Ephraim my dear Son? is hee a pleaſant childe? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my bowels are troubled for him: I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> The Mothers bowels can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not more yearn after the tender babe, than Gods doth after his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſed ones. As <hi>Moſes</hi> his Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, when ſhee had put him into<note place="margin">Exod. 2.</note> the Ark of Bul-ruſhes, wept to ſee
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:170508:156"/> the babe weep, and when ſhee was turned from him, ſhee could not but caſt a weeping eye of love to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him: So when God turns a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide from his people, yet hee can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but caſt an eye of love towards them. <hi>Hoſea 11. 8. How ſhall I give thee up, O Ephraim? &amp;c.</hi> Here are four ſeveral hows in the text, the like not to bee found in the whole book of God. I am even at a ſtand, juſtice calls for vengeance, but mercy interpoſeth; my bowels yearn, my heart melts: O! how ſhall I give thee up? O! I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not give thee up, I will not give thee up. Gods love is alwaies like himſelf, unchangeable, his love is everlaſting, it is a love that never decaies, nor waxes cold, it is like the ſtone <hi>Albeſtos,</hi> of which <hi>Solinus</hi> writes, that being once hot, it can never bee cooled again.</p>

But</p>
                  <p>Sixthly, Hereby the Lord will train up his ſervants in that preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous life of faith, which is the moſt honourable, and the moſt happy life in all the world. 2 <hi>Cor. 5. 7.

                  <p>Firſt, That it muſt bee granted, that a good name is one of the choiceſt Jewels in a Chriſtians Crown; though a great name ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times is little worth, yet a good name is rather to bee choſen than great riches, it is better to have a good name abroad, than ſilver or
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:170508:166"/> gold laid up in a cheſt at home. <hi>A good name is better than precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> Eccleſ. 7. 1. Precious oint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were greatly in uſe, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly eſteemed of among the Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites, in thoſe Eaſtern parts; they<note place="margin">Iſa. 39. 2 A good re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown is better than a golden girdle, ſaith the French Proverb.</note> were laid up among the moſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious things even in the Kings trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury. Sweet ointments can but af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the ſmell, and comfort the brain, and delight the outward man; they reach not the beſt part, the noble part, <hi>viz.</hi> the ſoul, the conſcience of a Chriſtian; but a good name doth both; what is the perfume of the noſtrils, to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fume of the heart?</p>
                  <p>I have read, that in ſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries they have a certain Art of drawing of Pigeons to their Dove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſes in thoſe Countries by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nointing the wings of one of them with ſweet ointment, and that Pigeon being ſent abroad, doth by the fragrancy of that ointment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quoy, invite, and allure others to that houſe where it ſelf is a dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick; ſuch is the fragrancy of a
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:170508:167"/> good name, that it draws other men after the ſavour thereof. Among all ſorts and ranks of men in the world, a good name hath an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tractive faculty; it is a precious ointment that draws hearers to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend good Preachers, Patients to attend Phyſicians, Clients to attend Lawyers, Scholars to attend School-maſters, and Cuſtomers to attend Shopkeepers, who with <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrius,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">3 Joh. 12.</note> hath a good report of all good men: Let a mans good name bee but up, and hee cannot eaſily want any thing that men or mony can help him to; a good name will bring a man into favour and keep a man in favour with all that are good; therefore ſaith the Moraliſts,</p>

                  </lg>
                  <p>Whatſoever commodity you loſe, bee ſure yet to preſerve that Jewel of a good name; a Chriſtian
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:170508:167"/> ſhould bee moſt chary of his good name, for a good name anſwers to all things, as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſpeaks of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Ego ſi bonam famam ſervaſſo, ſat dives ero;</hi> if I may but keep a good name, I have wealth enough ſaid<note place="margin">Plaut.</note> the Heathen; a Chriſtian ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther forgo gold, than let go a good name, and hee that robs a Chriſtian of his good name, is a worſe thief, than hee that robs him of his purſe, and better deſerves a hanging than hee, &amp;c. But</p>
                  <p>Secondly, It muſt bee granted, that a good name once loſt, is very hardly recovered again, a man may more eaſily recover a loſt friend, a loſt eſtate, than a loſt name; a good name is like a Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtructure, quickly ruined, but long a rearing; the Father of the Prodigal could ſay of his loſt ſon,<note place="margin">Luk. 15. <hi>ult.</hi>

                     <hi>This my Son was loſt, but is found, hee was dead, but is alive;</hi> but how few Chriſtians can ſay, this my good name was loſt, but is found, it was dead, but now it lives. As when

                  <p>In <hi>Japan</hi> the very children are ſo jealous of their reputation, that in caſe you loſe a trifle, and ſay to one of them, ſirrah, I beleeve you have ſtollen it, without any pauſe the boy will immediately cut off a joint from one of his fingers, and ſay, Sir, if you ſay true, I wiſh my finger may never heal again: Three things a Chriſtian ſhould ſtifly labour to maintain, 1 The honour of God. 2 The honour of the Goſpel. 3 The honour of his own name; If once a Chriſtians good name ſets in a cloud, it will bee long before it riſes again.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Though all this bee
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:170508:168"/> true, yet it hath been the portion of Gods deareſt Saints and ſervants to bee ſlandered, reproached, vili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,<note place="margin">Mat. 5. 10, 11, 12 1 Pet. 3. 14. ch. 4. 14 Pſal. 69. 7 Gen. 39.

<pb n="311" facs="tcp:170508:169"/> Saints to bee falſely accuſed, and to have their names and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes in the world reproached and flie-blown; do you hold your peace, ſeeing it is no worſe with you, than it was with them of whom this world was not world? The<note place="margin">Kimchi.</note> Rabbins ſay, that the world can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubſiſt without patient bearing of reproaches. But</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, Our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was ſadly reproached, and falſely accuſed; his precious name (that deſerves to bee alwaies writ in cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters of gold, as the <hi>Perſians</hi> uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally write their Kings) was of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten eclipſed, before the Sun was e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipſed at his death; his ſweet name, that was ſweeter than all ſweets, was often crucified before his body. Oh the ſtones of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach that were frequently rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon that name by which wee muſt bee ſaved, if ever wee are ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved! Oh the jears, the ſcoffs, the ſcorns that were caſt upon that name that can onely bleſs us. The

               <p>Fourthly, God delaies and puts off his people many times, that hee may make a fuller diſcovery of themſelves to themſelves. Few Chriſtians ſee themſelves, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand themſelves; by delaies God diſcovers much of a mans ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full ſelf to his religious ſelf, much of his worſer part to his better part, of his ignoble part, to his moſt noble part. When the fire is put under the pot, then the ſcum appears: ſo when God delaies a poor ſoul, Oh! how doth the ſcum of pride, the ſcum of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, the ſcum of quarrel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, the ſcum of diſtruſt, the ſcum of impatience, the ſcum of deſpair,<note place="margin">2 King. 6. 33</note> diſcover it ſelf in the heart of a poor creature?

But</p>
               <p>Fifthly, God delaies and puts off his people, to enhaunce, to raiſe the price of mercy, the price of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance; wee uſually ſet the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt price, the greateſt eſteem upon ſuch things that wee obtain with greateſt difficulty; what we dearly<note place="margin">Act. 22. 28 Cant. 3. 4</note> buy, that we highly prize; the more

               <p>Sixthly, The Lord delaies his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that hee may pay them home in their own coin. God ſometimes loves to retaliate. The Spouſe puts off Chriſt, <hi>Cant. 5. 2. I have put off</hi>

<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170508:185"/> haſt no reaſon to complain. But</p>
               <p>Seventhly and laſtly, The Lord delaies his people, that Heaven may be the more ſweet to them at laſt; here they meet with many delaies, and with many put offs, but in Heaven they ſhall never meet with one put off, with one delay; here many times they call and cry, and can get no anſwer;<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 8, 44</note> here they knock and bounce, and yet the door of grace and mercy o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens not to them; but in Heaven they ſhall have mercy at the firſt word, at the firſt knock; there, whatever heart can wiſh ſhall with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out delay be enjoyed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here God ſeems to ſay ſometimes, ſouls, you have miſtaken the door, or I am not at leaſure, or others muſt be ſerved before you, or come ſome other time, &amp;c.

<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170508:185"/> ſay to any of his Saints in Heaven, come to morrow; ſuch language the Saints ſometimes hear here, but ſuch language is no waies ſuitable to a glorified condition; and therefore ſeeing that the Lord ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver delaies his people, but upon great and weighty accounts, let his people bee ſilent before him, let them not mutter nor murmure, but be mute.

The ſenſe of pardon took away the ſenſe of pain, the ſenſe of forgiveneſs took away the ſenſe of ſickneſs. Aſſurance of pardon will take away the pain, the ſting, the trouble of every trouble and affliction that a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian meets with; no affliction will daunt, ſtartle or ſtagger an aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Chriſtian; aſſured Chriſtians<note place="margin">Pſal. 23. 1, 4, 5, 6, 7</note> will be patient and ſilent under all. <hi>Melanchthon</hi> makes mention of a godly woman, who having upon her death-bed been in much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, and afterward much comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, brake out into theſe words, Now, and not till now, I under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the meaning of theſe words, <hi>Thy ſins are forgiven;</hi> the ſenſe of which did mightily chear and quiet her: Hee that hath got this Jewel of aſſurance in his boſome,

               <p>I have read a ſtory of a man that had a ſute, and when his cauſe was to be heard, hee applied him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to three friends, to ſee what they would do for him; one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, hee would bring him as far on his journey as hee could; the

Ah Chriſtian! thou doſt not know what a world of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief one unmortified luſt may do; and therefore let nothing ſatisfie thee but the blood of all thy luſts.</p>
               <p>Seventhly, If you would bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under your greateſt afflictions, your ſharpeſt trials, then make this
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170508:194"/> conſideration your daily compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, <hi>viz.</hi> That all the afflictions that come upon you, come upon you by and through that covenant of grace that God hath made with you; in the covenant of grace, God hath engaged himſelf to keep you<note place="margin">Jer. 32. 36,—<hi>ult.</hi>
                  </note> from the evils, ſnares and tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the world; in the covenant of grace God hath engaged himſelf to purge away your ſins to brigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten and encreaſe your graces, to crucifie your hearts to the world, and to prepare you, and preſerve you to his heavenly Kingdome; and by afflictions hee effects all this, and that according to his co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant too, <hi>Pſal. 89. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. If his children forſake my Law, and walk not in my commandements; If they break my ſtatutes, and keep not my commandements;</hi> in theſe words you have a ſuppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Saints may fall both into ſins of commiſſion, and ſins of omiſſion; in the following words you have Gods gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Then will I viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170508:194"/> with the rod, and their ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities with ſtripes.</hi> God engages himſelf by promiſe and covenant, not onely to chide and check, but alſo to correct his people for their ſins. <hi>Nevertheleſs, my loving kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs will I not utterly take from him, nor ſuffer my faithfulneſs to fail.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are fruits of Gods faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, to which the covenant bindes him; God would bee un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful, if firſt or laſt, more or leſs, hee did not afflict his people; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions are part of that gracious covenant which God hath made<note place="margin">Pſal. 119. 75</note> with his people; afflictions are mercies, yea covenant-mercies. Hence it is that God is called the terrible God, keeping covenant and mercy, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 5. Becauſe by his covenant of mercy hee is bound to afflict and chaſtiſe his people. God by covenant is bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve his people, and not to ſuffer them to periſh, and happy are they that are preſerved, whether in Salt and Vinegar, or in Wine and Sugar: All the afflictions that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170508:195"/> come upon a wicked man, come upon him by virtue of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and ſo are curſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but all the afflictions that come upon a gracious man, they come upon him by virtue of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and ſo they are bleſt unto him; and therefore hee hath eminent cauſe to hold his peace, to lay his hand upon his mouth.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, If you would bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and quiet under afflictions, then dwell much upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> that all your afflictions do but reach the worſer, the baſer, and the ignobler part of a Chriſtian, <hi>viz.</hi> his body, his outward man.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> Though our outward man decay, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. As <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> the Heathen, ſaid, when hee was beaten by the Tyrants, Beat on, it is not <hi>Ariſtarchus</hi> you beat, it is<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 23 3 John 2.</note> onely his ſhell. <hi>Timothy</hi> had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry healthful ſoul in a crazy body, and <hi>Gaius</hi> had a very proſperous
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:170508:195"/> ſoul in a weak diſtempered body. <hi>Epictetus</hi> and many of the more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined Heathens, have long ſince concluded, that the body was the organ (or veſſel) the ſoul was the man and Merchandize. Now, all the troubles and afflictions that a Chriſtian meets with, they do not reach his ſoul, they touch not his conſcience, they make no breach upon his noble part; and therefore hee hath cauſe to hold his peace, and to lay his hands upon his mouth; the ſoul is the breath of God, the beauty of man, the wonder of Angels, and the envy<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9 Zach. 12. 1</note> of Devils, it is a caeleſtial plant, and of a divine off-ſpring; it is an immortal ſpirit; ſouls are of an Angelick nature, a man is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel cloathed in clay; the ſoul is a greater miracle in man, than all the miracles wrought amongſt men; the ſoul is a <hi>demi-ſemi</hi>-God dwelling in a houſe of clay. Now, it is not in the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward troubles and afflictions that a Chriſtian meets with, to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170508:196"/> reach his ſoul; and therefore hee may well ſit mute under the ſmarting Rod.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If thou wouldeſt bee ſilent and quiet under the ſaddeſt providences, and ſoreſt trials, then keep up Faith in continual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe; Now Faith in the exerciſe of it will quiet and ſilence the ſoul; thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1 By bringing the ſoul to ſit<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 8 Pſa. 17. 15</note> down ſatisfied in the naked enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2 By drying up the ſprings of pride, ſelf-love, impatience, mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring, unbeleef, and the carnal delights of this world.</p>
               <p n="3">3 By preſenting to the ſoul greater, ſweeter, and better things<note place="margin">Heb. 11. 8, 9, 10, 14. Phil. 3. 7, 8</note> in Chriſt, than any this world doth afford.</p>
               <p n="4">4 By leſſening the ſouls eſteem of all outward vanities; do but keep up the exerciſe of Faith, and thou wilt keep ſilent before the Lord. No man ſo mute, as hee whoſe Faith is ſtill buſie about in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible objects.</p>
               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:170508:196"/>
               <p>Tenthly, If you would keep ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then keep humble before the Lord. Oh! labour every day to bee more humble, and more low, and little in your own eyes; who<note place="margin">Job 7. 1, 18</note> am I, ſaith the humble ſoul, but that God ſhould croſs mee in this mercy, and take away that mercy, and paſs a ſentence of death upon every mercy? I am not worthy of the leaſt mercy, I deſerve not a crum of mercy, I have forfeited<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 16</note> every mercy, I have improved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a mercy. Onely by pride comes contention; it is onely pride that puts men upon contending with God and men; an humble ſoul will lye quiet at the foot of God, it will bee contented with bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; As you ſee ſheep can live upon the bare Commons, which a fat Oxe cannot. A Dinner of green herbs reliſheth well with the humble mans palate, whereas a ſtalled Oxe is but a courſe diſh to a proud mans ſtomack; an humble heart thinks none leſs than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, nor none worſe than himſelf;
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170508:197"/> an humble heart looks upon ſmall<note place="margin">Gen. 32. 10, 11. <hi>Auſtin</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing asked what was the firſt grace? an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; what the ſecond? hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility; what the third? hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility.</note> mercies, as great mercies, and great afflictions, as ſmall afflictions; and ſmall afflictions, as no afflictions; and therefore ſits mute and quiet under all; do <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ut keep humble, and you will keep ſilent before the Lord; pride kicks, and flings, and frets, but an humble man hath ſtill his hand upon his mouth. Every thing on this ſide Hell is mercy, much mercy, rich mercy, to an humble ſoul; and therefore hee holds his peace.</p>
               <p>Eleventhly, If you would keep ſilence under the afflicting hand of God, then keep cloſe, hold faſt theſe ſoul-ſilencing and ſoul-quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maxims or principles. As</p>
               <p>Firſt, That the worſt that God doth to his people in this world, is in order to the making of them a Heaven on Earth; hee brings them into a wilderneſs, but it is, that hee may ſpeak comfortably to them: he<note place="margin">Hoſ. 2. 14</note> caſts them into the fiery furnace,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170508:197"/> but it is, that they may have more of his company; doe the ſtones come thick and threefold about <hi>Stephens</hi> ears? it is but to knock<note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> him the nearer to Chriſt, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-ſtone, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then hold faſt this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That what God wills is beſt;<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10</note> when hee wills ſickneſs, ſickneſs is better than health; when hee wills weakneſs, weakneſs is better than ſtrength; when hee wills want, want is better than wealth; when hee wills reproach, reproach is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than honour; when hee wills death, death is better than life. As God is wiſdome it ſelf, and ſo knows that which is beſt, ſo hee is goodneſs it ſelf, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing but that which is beſt; therefore hold thy peace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thou wouldeſt bee ſilent under thy greateſt afflictions, then hold faſt to this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord will bear thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170508:198"/> in all thy afflictions, <hi>Iſa. 41. 10, ch. 43. 2. Pſal. 23. 4. Pſal. 90. 15. Dan. 3. 25. Gen. 39. 20, 21. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16, 17. Theſe Scriptures are breaſts full of divine conſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; theſe wells of ſalvation are full; will you turn to them and draw out, that your ſouls may bee ſatisfied and quieted.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, If you would bee ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under your afflictions, then hold faſt this principle, that the Lord hath more high, more noble, and more bleſſed ends in the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you, than hee hath in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of the men of the world. The ſtalk and the ear of corn fall upon the threſhing flore, under one and the ſame flail, but the one is ſhattered in peeces, the other is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; from one and the ſame Olive, and from under one and the ſame preſs is cruſhed out both Oil and dreggs, but the one is tunn'd up for uſe, the other thrown out as unſerviceable; and by one and the ſame breath the fields are perfumed
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170508:198"/> with ſweetneſs, and annoyed with unpleaſant ſavours: ſo, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do befall good and bad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as the Scripture ſpeaks, yet<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9. 2</note> the Lord will effect more glorious ends by thoſe afflictions that befall his people, than hee will effect by thoſe that befall wicked men; and therefore the Lord puts his people into the furnace, for their trial<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the wicked for their ruine; the one is bettered by affliction, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is made worſe; the one is made ſoft and tender by afflictions, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more hard and obdurate; the one is drawn nearer to God by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, the other is driven further from God, &amp;c.</p>
