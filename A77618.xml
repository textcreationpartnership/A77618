            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

But</p>
            <p>Fourthly, Its marvelous Å¿uitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s and uÅ¿efulneÅ¿s under theÅ¿e great turns and changes that have paÅ¿t upon us. As every wiÅ¿e husbandman ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erves the fitteÅ¿t Å¿eaÅ¿ons to Å¿ow his Å¿eed; Å¿ome hee Å¿ows in the Autumn, and fall of the leaf, Å¿ome, in the spring<note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 28. 25</note> of the year, Å¿ome in a dry Å¿eaÅ¿on, and Å¿ome in a wet, Å¿ome in a moiÅ¿t clay, and Å¿ome in a Å¿andy dry ground: So every Å¿piritual husbandman muÅ¿t obÅ¿erve the
<pb facs="tcp:170508:6"/> fitteÅ¿t times to Å¿ow his spiritual Å¿eed in, hee hath heavenly Å¿eed by him for all occaÅ¿ions and Å¿eaÅ¿ons, for Å¿pring and fall, for all grounds, heads and hearts; now whether the Å¿eed Å¿own in the following TreatiÅ¿e bee not Å¿uitable to the times and Å¿eaÅ¿ons wherein wee are caÅ¿t, is left to the judgement of the prudent Reader to determine; if the Author had thought otherwiÅ¿e, this babe had been Å¿tifled in the womb.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, The good acceptance that my other weak labours have found; God hath bleÅ¿t them, not onely to the<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 21 Phil. 1. 9, 10, 11</note> conviction, the edification, confirmation, and conÅ¿olation of many, but alÅ¿o to the converÅ¿ion of many. God is a free Agent to work by what hand hee plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿es, and Å¿ometimes hee takes pleaÅ¿ure<note place="margin">1 Cor. 1. 17,â29</note> to do great things by weak means, that no fleÅ¿h may glory in his preÅ¿ence. God will not deÅ¿piÅ¿e the day of Å¿mall things, and who or what art thou that dareÅ¿t de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿piÅ¿e that day? the Spirit breathes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whoÅ¿e preaching and writing hee<note place="margin">John 3</note> pleaÅ¿es, and all proÅ¿pers according as that wind blows.</p>

Such Å¿tupidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is a curÅ¿e that many a man lies under: But this Stoical Silence, which is but a Å¿inful fullenneÅ¿s, is not the Silence here meant.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a Politick Silence: Many are Å¿ilent out of policy, Å¿hould they not bee Å¿ilent, they Å¿hould lay themÅ¿elves more open, either to the rage and fury of men, or elÅ¿e to the plots and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿igns of men; to prevent which they are Å¿ilent, and will lay their hands upon their mouths, that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers may not lay their hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their eÅ¿tates, lives, or liberties. <hi>And Saul alÅ¿o went home to Giheah,</hi>

                  </gap> though hee had been deaf. This new King, being but newly entred up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:170508:17"/> his Kingly Government, and obÅ¿erving his condition to bee but mean and low, his friends but few, and his enemies many and potent, Sons of <hi>Belial, i. e.</hi> men without yoak (as the word Å¿ignifies) men that were deÅ¿perately wicked, that were mark'd out for hell, that were even incarnate Devils, who would neither Å¿ubmit to reaÅ¿on, nor Religion, nor bee governed by the Laws of Nature, nor of Nations, nor yet by the Laws of God; now this young Prince, to prevent Å¿edition and rebellion,<note place="margin">Hear, Å¿ee, and be Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, if thou wilt live in peace, is a French Proverb.</note> blood and deÅ¿truction, prudently and politickly chuÅ¿es rather to lay his hand upon his mouth, than to take a Woolf by the ear, or a Lion by the beard; hee wanted nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wit nor will to bee mute, hee turns a deaf ear to all they Å¿ay, his unÅ¿etled condition requiring Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry</hi> the Å¿ixth, Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> uÅ¿ed to Å¿ay (<hi>Qui neÅ¿cit ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere, neÅ¿cit loqui</hi>) hee that knows not how to bee Å¿ilent, knows not
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:170508:17"/> how to Å¿peak. <hi>Saul</hi> knew this was a time for Silence, hee knew his work was rather to bee an Auditor, than an Oratour: But this is not the Silence the Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ition Å¿peaks of.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is a fooliÅ¿h Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Some fools there bee that can neither do well, nor Å¿peak well; and becauÅ¿e they cannot word it, neither as they would, nor as they Å¿hould, they are Å¿o wiÅ¿e as to bee mute, <hi>Prov. 17. 28. Even a fool, when hee holdeth his peace, is counted wiÅ¿e: and hee that Å¿hutteth his lips, is eÅ¿teemed a man of underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</hi> As hee cannot bee wiÅ¿e that Å¿peaks much, Å¿o hee cannot bee known for a fool that Å¿aies no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. There are many wiÅ¿e fools in the world; there are many Å¿illy Å¿ouls, who by holding their tongues, gain the credit and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of being diÅ¿creet men: Hee that doth not diÅ¿cover his want of wiÅ¿dome by fooliÅ¿h babling, is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted wiÅ¿e, though hee may bee
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:170508:18"/> otherwiÅ¿e. Silence is Å¿o rare a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, where wiÅ¿dome doth regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late it, that it is accounted a vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue where folly doth impoÅ¿e it. Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence was Å¿o highly honoured a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the old <hi>Romans,</hi> that they erected Altars to it. That man Å¿hall paÅ¿s for a man of underÅ¿tand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, who Å¿o far underÅ¿tands him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, as to hold his tongue: For though it be a great miÅ¿ery to be a fool, yet it is a greater that a man cannot bee a fool, but hee muÅ¿t needs Å¿hew it: But this fooliÅ¿h Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is not the Silence here meant.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a Å¿ullen Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Many to gratifie an hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, a luÅ¿t, are Å¿ullenly Å¿ilent; theÅ¿e are troubled with a dumb Devil, which was the worÅ¿t De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil of all the Devils you read of in the Scripture, <hi>Mark</hi> 9. 17,â28.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural HiÅ¿tory mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth<note place="margin">Lib. 7 cap. 2.</note> mention of a certain people in the Indies upon the River <hi>Ganges,</hi> called <hi>AÅ¿tomi,</hi> that have no mouth,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:170508:18"/> but do onely feed upon the Å¿mell of herbs and flowers. Certainly there is a Generation amongÅ¿t us, who when they are under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of God, have no mouths to plead with God, no lips to praiÅ¿e God, nor no tongues to juÅ¿tifie God; theÅ¿e are poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ed with a dumb Devil, and this dumb Devil had poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿t <hi>Ahab</hi> for a time, 1 <hi>King. 21. 4. And Ahab came into his houÅ¿e, heavy and diÅ¿pleaÅ¿ed, and laid him down upon his bed, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away his face, and would eat no bread. Ahabs</hi> ambitious humor, his covetous humor, being croÅ¿t, hee is reÅ¿olved to Å¿tarve himÅ¿elf, and to dye of the Å¿ullens. A Å¿ullen Silence is both a Å¿in and a puniÅ¿hment; no Devil frets and vexes, wears and waÅ¿tes the Å¿pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits of a man, like this dumb De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, like this Å¿ullen Silence.</p>
               <p>Some write of a certain Devil whom they call <hi>Hudgin,</hi> who will not (they Å¿ay) hurt any body, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept hee bee wronged. I cannot Å¿peak Å¿o favourably of a Å¿ullen Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence,
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:170508:19"/> for that wrongs many at once, God and ChriÅ¿t, bodies and Å¿ouls: But this is not the Silence here meant.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, There is a forced Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: Many are Å¿ilent perforce; hee that is under the power of his enemie, though hee Å¿uffer many hard things, yet hee is Å¿ilent under his Å¿ufferings, becauÅ¿e hee knows hee is liable to worÅ¿e; hee that hath taken away his liberty, may take away his life; hee that hath taken away his money, may take off his head; hee that hath let him blood in the foot, may let him blood in the throat, if hee will not bee Å¿till and quiet; and this works Silence perforce: So when many are under the afflicting hand of God, conÅ¿cience tells them, that now they are under the hand of an enemy, and the power of that God whom they have diÅ¿honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, whoÅ¿e Son they have cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, whoÅ¿e Spirit they have grieved, whoÅ¿e righteous Laws
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:170508:19"/> they have tranÅ¿greÅ¿Å¿ed, whoÅ¿e Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances they have deÅ¿piÅ¿ed, and whoÅ¿e People they have abuÅ¿ed and oppoÅ¿ed. And that hee that hath taken away one childe, may take away every childe; and hee that hath taken away the wife, might have taken away the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band; and hee that hath taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way Å¿ome part of the eÅ¿tate, might have taken away all the eÅ¿tate; and that hee who hath inflicted Å¿ome diÅ¿tempers upon the body, might have caÅ¿t both body and Å¿oul into hell fire for ever; and hee that hath Å¿hut him up in his chamber, may Å¿hut him out of Heaven at pleaÅ¿ure: The thoughts and Å¿enÅ¿e<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Oculos quos pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catum claudit, paena ape<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit.</hi> Gr. The eye that Å¿in Å¿huts af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen.</note> of theÅ¿e things, makes many a Å¿inner Å¿ilent under the hand of God; but this is but a forced Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence: And Å¿uch was the Silence of <hi>Philip</hi> the Å¿econd King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who when his invincible Armado that had been three years a fitting, was loÅ¿t, hee gave command, that all over <hi>Spain,</hi> they Å¿hould give thanks to God and the Saints, that
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:170508:20"/> it was no more grievous. As the cudgel forces the Dogg to be quiet and Å¿till; and the Rod forces the childe to bee Å¿ilent and mute: Å¿o the apprehenÅ¿ions of what God hath done, and of what God may do, forces many a Å¿oul to bee Å¿ilent, <hi>Jer. 3. 10. 1 King.</hi> 14. 5,â18. But this is not the Å¿ilence here meant; a forced Silence is no Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence in the eye of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, There is a deÅ¿pairing Silence: A deÅ¿pairing Å¿oul is <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gor-MiÅ¿Å¿abib,</hi>

As the Scribe is more eyed, and properly Å¿aid to write, than the pen; and hee that maketh and keepeth the Clock, is more proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿aid to make it go and Å¿trike, than the wheels and weights that hang upon it; and as every work-man is more eyed, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly Å¿aid to effect his works, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than the tools which hee uÅ¿eth as his inÅ¿truments: Å¿o the Lord who is the chief Agent and mover in all actions, and who hath the greateÅ¿t hand in all our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, is more to bee eyed and owned, than any inferiour or Å¿ub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate cauÅ¿es whatÅ¿oever. So <hi>Job,</hi> hee beheld God in all, <hi>Job</hi> 1.
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:170508:22"/> 21. <hi>The Lord gave, and the Lord hath taken away:</hi> Had hee not Å¿een God in the affliction, hee would have cried out, Oh theÅ¿e wretched <hi>Chaldeans,</hi> they have plundred and Å¿poiled mee! TheÅ¿e wicked <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beans,</hi> they have robbed and wronged mee. <hi>Job</hi> diÅ¿cerns Gods CommiÅ¿Å¿ion in the <hi>Chaldeans</hi> and the <hi>Sabeans</hi> hands, and then laies his own hand upon his mouth. So <hi>Aaron</hi> beholding the hand of<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> God in the untimely death of his two Å¿ons, holds his peace, <hi>Levit.</hi> 10. 3. the Å¿ight of God in this Å¿ad<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> Å¿troak, is a bridle both to his mind and mouth, hee neither mutters nor murmurs. So <hi>JoÅ¿eph</hi> Å¿aw the hand of God, in his brethrens Å¿el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling of him into <hi>Egypt,</hi> Gen. 45. 8. and that Å¿ilences him.</p>
               <p>Men that Å¿ee not God in an af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, are eaÅ¿ily caÅ¿t into a fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriÅ¿h fit, they will quickly bee in a flame, and when their paÅ¿Å¿ions are up, and their hearts on fire, they will begin to bee Å¿awcy, and make no bones of telling God to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:170508:22"/> his teeth, that they do well to bee angry, <hi>Jonah</hi> 4. 8, 9. Such as will not acknowledge God to bee the author of all their afflictions, will bee ready enough to fall in with that mad principle of the Mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chees, who maintained the Devil to bee the Author of all calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. As if there could bee any e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil (of affliction) in the City, and the Lord have no hand in it, <hi>Amos</hi> 3. 6. Such as can Å¿ee the ordering hand of God in all their afflictions, will with <hi>David</hi> lay their hands upon their mouths, when the Rod of God is upon their backs, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 11, 12. If Gods hand bee not Å¿een in the affliction, the heart will do nothing but fret and rage under affliction.</p>
               <p>Secondly, It includes and takes in Å¿ome holy gracious apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ions, of the MajeÅ¿ty, Soveraignty, Dignity, Authority, and preÅ¿ence of that God, under whoÅ¿e afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hand we are, <hi>Hab. 2. 20. But the Lord is in his holy Temple, let all the
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:170508:23"/> earth bee Å¿ilent,</hi> or as the Hebrew reads it, <hi>bee Å¿ilent all the earth before his face.</hi> When God would have all the people of the earth to bee huÅ¿ht, quiet, and Å¿ilent before him, hee would have them to behold him in his Temple, where hee Å¿its in Å¿tate, in majeÅ¿ty, and glory. <hi>Zephan. 1. 7. Hold thy peace at the preÅ¿ence of the Lord God.</hi> Chat not, murmure not, repine not, quarrel not: WhiÅ¿t, Å¿tand mute, bee Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, lay thy hand on thy mouth, when his hand is upon thy back, who is (<hi>totus oculus</hi>) all-eye, to Å¿ee, as well as all hand, to puniÅ¿h. As the eyes of a well-drawn picture, are faÅ¿tened on thee which way Å¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever thou turneÅ¿t; Å¿o are the eies of the Lord; and therefore thou haÅ¿t cauÅ¿e to Å¿tand mute before him.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Aaron</hi> had an eye to the Å¿overaignty of God, and that Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences<note place="margin">Levit. 10. 3 Job 37. 23, 24. 1 Sam. 3. 11,â19.</note> him. And <hi>Job</hi> had an eye upon the majeÅ¿ty of God, and that Å¿tills him. And <hi>Elie</hi> had an eye upon the authority and preÅ¿ence of God, and that quiets him. A man
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:170508:23"/> never comes to humble himÅ¿elf, nor to bee Å¿ilent under the hand of God, till hee comes to Å¿ee the hand of God to bee a mighty hand, 1 <hi>Pet. 5. 6. Humble your Å¿elves there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore under the mighty hand of God.</hi> When men look upon the hand of God as a weak hand, a feeble hand, a low hand, a mean hand, their hearts riÅ¿e againÅ¿t his hand, <hi>Who is<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> the Lord,</hi> Å¿aid <hi>Pharaoh, that I Å¿hould obey his voice?</hi> Exod. 5. 2. And till <hi>Pharaoh</hi> came to Å¿ee the hand of God, as a mighty hand, and to feel it as a mighty hand, hee would not let <hi>IÅ¿rael</hi> go. When <hi>Tiriba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zus</hi> a Noble PerÅ¿ian was arreÅ¿ted, at firÅ¿t hee drew out his Å¿word and defended himÅ¿elf, but when they charged him in the Kings name, and informed him that they came from the King, and were commanded to bring him to the King, he yeelded willingly. So when afflictions arreÅ¿t us, we Å¿hall mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mure, and grumble, and Å¿truggle and Å¿trive even to the death, before wee Å¿hall yeeld to that God that
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:170508:24"/> Å¿trikes, till wee come to Å¿ee his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeÅ¿ty and authority, till wee come<note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 26. 11, 12 Rev. 1. 5.</note> to Å¿ee him as the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. It is Å¿uch a Å¿ight of God as this, that makes the heart to Å¿toop under his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty hand. The <hi>Thracians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<note place="margin">Herod.</note> ignorant of the dignity and majeÅ¿ty of God, when it thundred and lightned, uÅ¿ed to expreÅ¿s their madneÅ¿s and folly in Å¿hooting their arrows againÅ¿t Heaven, threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-wiÅ¿e. As a Å¿ight of his grace chears the Å¿oul, Å¿o a Å¿ight of his greatneÅ¿s and glory Å¿ilences the Å¿oul. But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A gracious, a prudent Silence, takes in a holy quietneÅ¿Å¿e<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Animus cujuÅ¿que eÅ¿t quiÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que,</hi> the mind is the man.</note> and calmneÅ¿Å¿e of mind and Å¿pirit under the afflicting hand of God: A gracious Silence Å¿huts out all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward heats, murmurings, fret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, quarrellings<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> wranglings, and boilings of heart, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 62. 1. Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly my Å¿oul keepeth Å¿ilence unto God, or is Å¿ilent or Å¿till; that is, my Å¿oul is quiet and Å¿ubmiÅ¿Å¿ive to
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:170508:24"/> God, all murmurings and repine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, paÅ¿Å¿ions and turbulent affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, being allayed, tamed and Å¿ubdued. This alÅ¿o is clear in the Text, and in the former inÅ¿tances of <hi>Aaron, Ely,</hi> and <hi>Job,</hi> they Å¿aw that it was a Father that put thoÅ¿e bitter cups into their hands, and love, that laid thoÅ¿e heavy croÅ¿Å¿es upon their Å¿houlders, and grace, that put thoÅ¿e yoaks about their necks; and this cauÅ¿ed much quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿Å¿e and calmneÅ¿Å¿e in their Å¿pirits. <hi>Marius</hi> bit in his pain, when the Chirurgian cut off his legg. Some men, when God cuts off this mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and that mercy from them, they bite in their pain, they hide and conceal their grief and trouble; but could you but look into their hearts, you would finde all in an up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roar, all out of order, all in a flame; and however they may Å¿eem to be cold without, yet they are all in a hot burning feaver within: Such a feaveriÅ¿h fit <hi>David</hi> was once in, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 39. 3. But certainly a holy Silence allaies all tumults in the
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:170508:25"/> mind, and makes a man in pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience<note place="margin">Luke 21. 19.</note> to poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿e his own Å¿oul, which next to his poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿Å¿ion of God, is the choiceÅ¿t and Å¿weeteÅ¿t poÅ¿Å¿eÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ion in all the world. The Law of Silence is as well upon that mans heart and mind, as it is upon his tongue, who is truly and divinely Å¿ilent under the rebuking hand of God. As tongue-Å¿ervice abÅ¿tract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note place="margin">IÅ¿a. 29. 13. Mat. 15. 8, 9.</note> from heart Å¿ervice, is no Å¿ervice in the account of God; Å¿o tongue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ilence abÅ¿tracted from heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ilence, is no Å¿ilence in the eÅ¿teem of God. A man is then graciouÅ¿ly Å¿ilent, when all is quiet within and without.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Terpander</hi> a Harper and a Poet, was one, that by the Å¿weetneÅ¿Å¿e of his verÅ¿e and muÅ¿ick, could allay the tumultuous motions of mens minds: As <hi>David</hi> by his Harp did <hi>Sauls.</hi> When Gods people are under the Rod, hee makes by his Å¿pirit and word Å¿uch Å¿weet muÅ¿ick in their Å¿ouls, as allaies all tumul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous motions, paÅ¿Å¿ions, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbations, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 94. 17, 18, 19.

               <p>Fourthly, A prudent, a holy<note place="margin">

Gods judging his people, is Gods correcting or chaÅ¿tening of his people, 1 <hi>Cor. 11. 32. When wee are judged, wee are chastened of the Lord. Davids</hi> great care when he was under the afflicting hand of God, was to clear the Lord of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juÅ¿tice: <hi>Ah Lord</hi> (Å¿aith hee) <hi>There is not the leaÅ¿t Å¿hew, Å¿pot, Å¿tain, ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿h, or mixture of injuÅ¿tice, in all the afflictions thou hast brought upon mee; I deÅ¿ire to take Å¿hame to my Å¿elf, and to Å¿et to my Å¿eal that the Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, and that there is no injuÅ¿tice, no cruelty, nor no extremity in all that the

Righteous art thou O Lord, and upright are thy judgements.</hi> Gods judgements are alwaies juÅ¿t, hee never afflicts but in faithfulneÅ¿Å¿e, his will is the rule of juÅ¿tice; and therefore a gracious Å¿oul dares not cavil nor queÅ¿tion his proceedings; the afflicted Å¿oul knows, that a righteous God can do nothing but that which is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous; it knows, that God is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controulable, and therefore the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted man puts his mouth in the duÅ¿t, and keeps Å¿ilence before him. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16. 10.

               <p>The BabyloniÅ¿h captivity was the Å¿oreÅ¿t, the heavieÅ¿t affliction that ever God inflicted upon any people under Heaven, witneÅ¿Å¿e that 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. &amp; <hi>Daniel</hi> 9. 12, &amp;c. yet under thoÅ¿e Å¿mart affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, wiÅ¿dome is juÅ¿tified of her children, <hi>Neh. 9. 33.

God, in that hee is good, can give no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, nor do nothing but that which is good, others do frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,

               <p>Fifthly, A holy Silence, takes in gracious, bleÅ¿Å¿ed, Å¿oul-quieting ConcluÅ¿ions, about the iÅ¿Å¿ue and event of thoÅ¿e afflictions that are upon us, <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 27,â34.

When Å¿ome told Prince <hi>Henry</hi> (that <hi>delitiae generis humani</hi>) that darling of mankind, that the Å¿ins of the people brought that affliction on him; O no, Å¿aid hee. I have Å¿ins enough of mine own to cauÅ¿e that; I have Å¿inned, Å¿aith <hi>David,</hi> but what have theÅ¿e poor Å¿heep done? When a ChriÅ¿tian is under

               <p>Fourthly, A holy, a prudent Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, doth not exclude the teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and inÅ¿tructing of others when wee are afflicted; the words of the afflicted Å¿tick cloÅ¿e<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> they many times work Å¿trongly, powerfully, Å¿trangely, Å¿avingly upon the Å¿ouls and conÅ¿ciences of others.

As the words of dying perÅ¿ons do ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times Å¿tick and work gloriouÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; Å¿o many times doth the words of afflicted perÅ¿ons, work very noblely and efficaciouÅ¿ly. I have read of one <hi>Adrianus,</hi> who Å¿eeing the Martyrs Å¿uffer Å¿uch grievous things in the cauÅ¿e of ChriÅ¿t, hee asked what that was which inabled them to Å¿uffer Å¿uch things? and one of them named that, 1 <hi>Cor. 2. 9.

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:170508:40"/> afflicted; the tongue of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted hath been to many as choice Å¿ilver, the words of the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted many times are both plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ing and profitable; they tickle the ear, and they win upon the heart; they Å¿lide inÅ¿enÅ¿ibly into the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers Å¿ouls, &amp; work efficaciouÅ¿ly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the hearers hearts. <hi>EccleÅ¿. 10. 12. The words of a wiÅ¿e mans mouth are gracious</hi> (or <hi>Grace,</hi> as the Hebrew hath it;) and Å¿o <hi>Hierome</hi> reads it, <hi>Verba oris Å¿apientis gratia,</hi> the words of the mouth of a wiÅ¿e man are grace: They miniÅ¿ter grace to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and they win grace and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour from others; gracious lips make gracious hearts; gracious words are a grace, an ornament to the Å¿peaker, and they are a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, a delight, and an advantage to the hearer.</p>
               <p>Now the words of a wiÅ¿e mans mouth, are never more gracious, than when hee is moÅ¿t afflicted and diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed. Now you Å¿hall finde moÅ¿t worth and weight in his words: Now his lips like the

No man hath ever yet been able to make good a charge againÅ¿t God, and wilt thou bee able? Å¿urely no.

<pb n="98" facs="tcp:170508:62"/> the particular reaÅ¿ons why hee laies his hand upon them.

Why is my pain perpetual, and my wound incurable? &amp;c.</hi> Though God hath alwaies reaÅ¿on for what hee doth, yet hee is not bound to Å¿hew us the reaÅ¿ons of his doings. <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s paÅ¿Å¿ion was up, his blood was hot, and now nothing will Å¿ilence nor Å¿atisfie him, but the reaÅ¿ons why his pain was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual, and his wound incurable, So <hi>Job, chap. 7. 20. Why haÅ¿t thou Å¿et mee as a mark against thee, Å¿o that I am a burden to my Å¿elf?</hi> It is an evil and a dangerous thing to cavil at, or to queÅ¿tion his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, who is the chief Lord of<note place="margin">Rom. 9. 20 Dan. 4. 34, 35</note> all, and who may do with his own what hee pleaÅ¿eth? Hee is unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and uncontroulable; and therefore who Å¿hall Å¿ay what doeÅ¿t thou? As no man may que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tion his right to afflict him, nor his righteouÅ¿neÅ¿s in afflicting of him; Å¿o no man may queÅ¿tion the
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:170508:62"/> reaÅ¿ons why he afflicts him. As no man can compel him to give a reaÅ¿on of his doings; Å¿o no man may dare to ask him the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar reaÅ¿ons of his doings. Kings think themÅ¿elves not bound to give their Å¿ubjects a reaÅ¿on of their<note place="margin">EccleÅ¿. 8. 4</note> doings; and Å¿hall wee binde God to give us a reaÅ¿on of his doings? who is the King of Kings, and<note place="margin">Rev. 1. 5, 6</note> Lord of Lords, and whoÅ¿e will is the true reaÅ¿on, and onely rule of juÅ¿tice. The general grounds and reaÅ¿ons that God hath laid down in his word, why hee afflicts his people, as <hi>viz.</hi> for their profit, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 10. for the purging away of their Å¿ins, <hi>IÅ¿a.</hi> 1. 25. for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming of their lives, <hi>PÅ¿al.</hi> 119. 67. 71. and for the Å¿aving of their Å¿ouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11. 32.

As a man by gazing and prying into the body of the Sun may grow dark and dim, and Å¿ee leÅ¿s than otherwiÅ¿e hee might: So many by a curious prying into the Å¿ecret reaÅ¿ons of Gods dealings with them, come to grow Å¿o dark and dim, that they cannot Å¿ee thoÅ¿e plain reaÅ¿ons that God hath laid down in his word, why hee

               <p>Fourthly, ConÅ¿ider, it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ignoble and unworthy thing, to go to Å¿in your Å¿elves out of your troubles and Å¿traights; it argues a poor, a low, a weak, a daÅ¿terdly, and an effeminate Å¿pirit, to uÅ¿e baÅ¿e Å¿hifts, to Å¿huffle your Å¿elves out of your troubles.

               <p>Sixthly and laÅ¿tly, ConÅ¿ider this, that your very attempting to Å¿in, and Å¿hift your Å¿elves out of troubles and afflictions, will coÅ¿t you dear; it will coÅ¿t you many prayers, many tears, many Å¿ighs,<note place="margin">A man may buy any thing too dear, but ChriÅ¿t, Grace, his own Soul, and the GoÅ¿pel.</note> many groans, many gripes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny terrours, and many horrours. <hi>Peter</hi> by attempting to Å¿in himÅ¿elf out of trouble, Å¿ins himÅ¿elf into a Sea of Å¿orrows, <hi>Matth. 26. ult.

               <p>
                  <hi>Clement</hi> obÅ¿erves, That every night when hee heard the Cock crow, hee would fall upon his knees and weep bitterly, others Å¿ay, that his face was furrowed with continual tears. Were <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, David, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Jonah</hi>

Ah ChriÅ¿tians! it is far better to bee quiet and Å¿ilent under your Å¿ufferings, than to pay Å¿o dear for attempting to Å¿in, and Å¿hift your Å¿elves out of your Å¿ufferings.

And grace that is hid in nature, as Å¿weet wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in RoÅ¿e-leaves, is then moÅ¿t fra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grant, when the fire of affliction is put under to diÅ¿till it out.

                  <hi>Pliny</hi> in his natural hiÅ¿tory,<note place="margin">Lib. 12. cap. 9.</note> writeth of certain Trees growing in the red Seas, which being beat upon by the waves, Å¿tand like a

In the Sea of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions God will make his people Å¿tand like a rock, they Å¿hall bee immoveable, and invincible, and the more the waves of afflictions beat upon them, the better they Å¿hall bee, the more they Å¿hall thrive in grace and godlineÅ¿s. Now how Å¿hould this ingage ChriÅ¿tians to bee mute and Å¿ilent under all their troubles and trials in this world, conÅ¿idering that they Å¿hall all work for their good? God cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tiÅ¿es our carkaÅ¿Å¿es, to heal our conÅ¿ciences, hee afflicts our bodies, to Å¿ave our Å¿ouls, hee gives us gall and wormwood here, that the pleaÅ¿ures that bee at his right hand may bee the more Å¿weet hereafter; here hee layes us upon a bed of thorns, that wee may look and long more for that eaÅ¿ie bed of down (his boÅ¿ome) in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</p>

As there is a curÅ¿e wrapt up in a wicked mans health, Å¿o there is a bleÅ¿Å¿ing wrapt up in a godly mans Å¿ickneÅ¿s: As there is a curÅ¿e wrapt up in a wicked mans Å¿trength, Å¿o there is a bleÅ¿Å¿ing wrapt up in a godly mans weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s: As there is a curÅ¿e wrapt up in a wicked mans wealth, Å¿o there is a bleÅ¿Å¿ing wrapt up in a godly mans want: As there is a curÅ¿e wrapt up in a wicked mans ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, Å¿o there is a bleÅ¿Å¿ing wrapt up in a godly mans reproach: As there is a curÅ¿e wrapt up in all a wicked mans mercies, Å¿o there is a bleÅ¿Å¿ing wrapt up in all a godly mans croÅ¿Å¿es, loÅ¿Å¿es, and changes: and why then Å¿hould hee not Å¿it mute and Å¿ilent before the Lord? But</p>
               <p>Thirdly, ConÅ¿ider, That a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Å¿ilence is that excellent precious grace, that lends a hand of Å¿up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port to every grace. Silence is<note place="margin">Rom. 15. 4</note>
                  <pb n="124" facs="tcp:170508:75"/> 
                  <hi>Custos,</hi> the Keeper of all other vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, it lends a hand to Faith, a hand to Hope, a hand to Love, a hand to Humility, a hand to Self<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denial, &amp;c. A holy Å¿ilence hath its influences upon all other graces that bee in the Å¿oul, it cauÅ¿es the RoÅ¿e-buds of grace to bloÅ¿Å¿ome and bud forth. Silence is (<hi>virtus verÅ¿ata circa adverÅ¿a</hi>) a grace that keeps a man gracious in all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; in every condition Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence is a ChriÅ¿tians right hand; in proÅ¿perity, it bears the Å¿oul up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all the envy, malice, hatred and cenÅ¿ures of the world; in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verÅ¿ity, it bears the Å¿oul up under all the neglect, Å¿corn and contempt that a ChriÅ¿tian meets with in the world; it makes every bitter Å¿weet, every burden light, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very yoak eaÅ¿ie. And this the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Heathen Å¿eemed to intimate in placing the Image of <hi>Angeronia</hi> with the mouth bound upon the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar of <hi>Volupia,</hi> to Å¿hew, that Å¿ilence under Å¿ufferings, was the ready way to attain true comfort, and make
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:170508:75"/> every bitter Å¿weet. No man ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours God, nor no man juÅ¿tifies God at Å¿o high a rate, as hee who layes his hand upon his mouth, when the Rod of God is upon his back. But</p>
               <p>Fourthly, To move you to Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence under your Å¿oreÅ¿t and your Å¿harpeÅ¿t trials, conÅ¿ider, That you<note place="margin">Lam. 3. 39 Mic. 7. 7, 8, 9</note> have deÅ¿erved greater and heavier afflictions than thoÅ¿e you are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; hath God taken away one mercy? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved to bee Å¿tript of all; hath hee taken away the delight of thine eyes? he might have taken away the delight of thy Å¿oul; art thou under outward wants? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der outward and inward together; art thou caÅ¿t upon a Å¿ick-bed? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved a bed in Hell; art thou under this ach and that pain? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved to bee under all aches and pains at once; hath God chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ed thee with whips? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved to bee chaÅ¿tiÅ¿ed with<note place="margin">1 King. 12. 11, 14.</note> Scorpions; art thou fallen from
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:170508:76"/> the higheÅ¿t pinacle of honour to be the Å¿corn and contempt of men? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved to bee Å¿corned and contemned by God and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels; art thou under a Å¿evere whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping? thou haÅ¿t deÅ¿erved an utter damning. Ah ChriÅ¿tians! let but your eyes bee fixt upon your de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merits, and your hands will bee quickly upon your mouths; what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is leÅ¿s than a final Å¿eparation from God, whatever is leÅ¿s than Hell, is mercy; and therefore you have cauÅ¿e to bee Å¿ilent under the Å¿marteÅ¿t dealings of God with you. But</p>
               <p>Fifthly, ConÅ¿ider, A quiet Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Å¿pirit is of great eÅ¿teem with God: God Å¿ets the greateÅ¿t value upon perÅ¿ons of a quiet Å¿pirit, 1 <hi>Pet. 3. 4. But let it bee the hidden man of the heart, in that which is not corruptible, even the ornament of a meek and quiet Å¿pirit, which is in the Å¿ight of God of great price.</hi> A quiet Å¿pirit is a Å¿park of the divine na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, it is a ray, a beam of glory,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:170508:76"/> it is a heaven-born Å¿pirit: No man is born with a holy Silence in his heart, as hee is born with a tongue in his mouth: this is a flower of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiÅ¿e, it is a precious Jem that God makes very great reckoning of. A quiet Å¿pirit Å¿peaks a man moÅ¿t like to God, it capacitates a man for communion with God, it renders a man moÅ¿t Å¿erviceable to God, and it obliges a man to moÅ¿t accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate walking with God: A meek and quiet Å¿pirit is an incorruptible ornament, much more valuable than gold.</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, There is a natural quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, which proceeds from a good temper and conÅ¿titution of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy.</p>
               <p>Secondly, There is a moral quietneÅ¿s, which proceeds from good education and breeding, which flows from good injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, inÅ¿tructions, and examples.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, There is an artificial
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:170508:77"/> quietneÅ¿s; Å¿ome have an art to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priÅ¿on their paÅ¿Å¿ions, and to lay a Law of reÅ¿traint upon their an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger and wrath, when they are all in a flame within: As you may<note place="margin">2 Sam. 13. 20,â33</note> Å¿ee in <hi>Cain, EÅ¿au, AbÅ¿alom,</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> who for a time caÅ¿t a cloÅ¿e cloak over their malice, when their hearts were Å¿et on fire of Hell: Å¿o <hi>Domitian</hi> would Å¿eem to love them beÅ¿t, whom hee willed leaÅ¿t Å¿hould live.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, There is a gracious quietneÅ¿s which is of the Å¿pirits in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuÅ¿ion, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 22,â25. Now this quietneÅ¿s of Å¿pirit, this Å¿piritual frame of heart, is of great price in the Å¿ight of God. God values it above the world, and therefore who would not covet it more than the world, yea more than life it Å¿elf? Certainly the great God Å¿ets a great price upon nothing but that which is of an invaluable price; what Å¿tretching, Å¿trugling and Å¿tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving is there for thoÅ¿e things that the great ones of the earth do high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:170508:77"/> prize? Ah what Å¿tretching of wits, intereÅ¿ts, and conÅ¿ciences is there this day, to gain and hold up that which juÅ¿tice will caÅ¿t down? how much better would it bee if all perÅ¿ons would in good earneÅ¿t Å¿truggle and Å¿trive, even as for life, after a quiet and Å¿ilent Å¿pirit, which the great and glorious God Å¿ets Å¿o great a price upon? this is a pearl of greateÅ¿t price, and happy is hee that purchaÅ¿es it, though it were with the loÅ¿s of all. But</p>
               <p>Sixthly, ConÅ¿ider, that if you Å¿it not quiet and Å¿ilent under your greateÅ¿t troubles, and your Å¿oreÅ¿t trials, you will bee found fighters againÅ¿t your own prayers. How often have you prayed that the will of God may bee done, yea, that it may bee done on the earth as the Angels (thoÅ¿e gliÅ¿tering Courtiers,<note place="margin">Mat. 6. 10</note> thoÅ¿e Princes of glory) do it now in Heaven? when troubles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions come upon you, the will of God is done, his will is accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliÅ¿hed, why then Å¿hould you fret,

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:170508:78"/> done, and yet when his will is done upon them, they are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reÅ¿t, they are Å¿till fretting againÅ¿t the Lord. Ah ChriÅ¿tians! have you not Å¿ins to fight againÅ¿t, and temptations to fight againÅ¿t, and a Devil to fight againÅ¿t yea a whole world to fight againÅ¿t? why then Å¿hould you bee found fighting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t your own prayers? But</p>
               <p>Seventhly, ConÅ¿ider, A holy Silence under the heavieÅ¿t bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens, the greateÅ¿t afflictions, the Å¿addeÅ¿t providences and changes, will make all tollerable, and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ie to a ChriÅ¿tian; the Å¿ilent Å¿oul can bear a burden without a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; thoÅ¿e burdens and troubles that will break a froward mans<note place="margin">Micah 7. 7, 8, 9, 10 PÅ¿al. 62. 1,â6</note> back, will not Å¿o much as break a Å¿ilent mans Å¿leep; thoÅ¿e afflictions that lye as heavy weights upon a murmurer, will lye as light as a feather upon a mute ChriÅ¿tian; that bed of Å¿orrow, which is as a bed of thorns to a fr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="132" facs="tcp:170508:79"/> bee as a bed of down to a Å¿ilent Å¿oul; a holy Silence unÅ¿tings every affliction, it takes off the weight of every burden, it adds Å¿weet to every bitter, it changes dark nights into SunÅ¿hiny daies, and terrible Å¿torms into deÅ¿irable calms; the Å¿malleÅ¿t Å¿ufferings will eaÅ¿ily vanquiÅ¿h an unquiet Å¿pirit, but a quiet Å¿pirit will as eaÅ¿ily triumph over the greateÅ¿t Å¿uffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. As little mercies are great mercies, Å¿o great Å¿ufferings are but little Å¿ufferings in the eye of a Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Å¿oul; the Å¿ilent Å¿oul never complains that his affliction is too great, his burthen too heavy, his croÅ¿s too weighty, his Å¿ufferings too many; Silence makes him victorious over all; And therefore as ever you would have heavy af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions light, and bee able to bear a burthen without a burthen, labour as for life after this holy Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence.

As the River <hi>Nilus</hi> bringeth forth many Crocodiles, and the Scorpion many Serpents at one birth, Å¿o murmuring is a
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170508:88"/> Å¿in that breeds and brings forth many Å¿ins at once: Murmuring is like the MonÅ¿ter <hi>Hydra,</hi> cut off one head, and many will riÅ¿e up in its room. Oh! therefore bend all thy Å¿trength againÅ¿t this Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Å¿in; As the King of <hi>Syria</hi> Å¿aid<note place="margin">1 Kings 22. 31.</note> to his Captains, <hi>Fight neither with Å¿mall nor great, but with the King of IÅ¿rael:</hi> So Å¿ay I, fight not Å¿o much againÅ¿t this Å¿in or that, but fight againÅ¿t your murmuring, which is a Mother Å¿in; make uÅ¿e of all your<note place="margin">Eph. 6. 10, 11.</note> ChriÅ¿tian armour, make uÅ¿e of all the ammunition of Heaven, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿troy the Mother, and in deÅ¿troy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of her, you will deÅ¿troy the daughters. When <hi>Goliah</hi> was Å¿lain, the PhiliÅ¿tians fled; when a General in an Army is cut off, the common Å¿ouldiers are eaÅ¿ily and quickly routed and deÅ¿troyed: So, deÅ¿troy but murmuring, and you will quickly deÅ¿troy diÅ¿obedience, ingratitude, impatience, diÅ¿truÅ¿t, &amp;c. Oh! kill this Mother Å¿in, that this may never kill thy Å¿oul. I have read of <hi>Senacherib,</hi> that after

               <p>Fourthly, ConÅ¿ider, That mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a God-provoking Å¿in; it is a Å¿in that provokes God, not

But</p>
               <p>Sixthly, ConÅ¿ider, That mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a mercy-imbittering Å¿in, a mercy-Å¿ouring Å¿in. As put the Å¿weeteÅ¿t things into a Å¿oure veÅ¿Å¿el, it Å¿oures them, or put them into a bitter veÅ¿Å¿el, and it imbitters them; murmuring puts gall and wormwood into every cup of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, that God gives into our hands. As holy Å¿ilence gives a Å¿weet taÅ¿te, a delightful relliÅ¿h to all a mans mercies; Å¿o murmuring imbitters all; the murmurer can taÅ¿te no Å¿weetneÅ¿s in his Å¿weeteÅ¿t morÅ¿els, every mercy, every morÅ¿el taÅ¿tes<note place="margin">Job 6. 6.</note> like the white of an Egge to him; this mercy, Å¿aith the murmurer, is not toothÅ¿ome, nor that mercy is
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170508:91"/> not wholeÅ¿ome; here is a mercy wants Å¿alt, and there is a mercy wants Å¿auce. A murmurer can taÅ¿te no Å¿weet, hee can feel no comfort, hee can take no delight in any mercy hee injoyes. The murmurer writes <hi>Marah,</hi> that is, bitterneÅ¿s upon all his mercies, and hee reads and taÅ¿tes bitterneÅ¿s in all his mercies. All the murmurers Grapes, are Grapes of Gall, and all their cluÅ¿ters are bitter, <hi>Deut. 32. 32. As to the hungry Å¿oul, every</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 27. 7</note>

               <p>Seventhly, ConÅ¿ider, That mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring is a mercy-deÅ¿troying Å¿in, a mercy-murthering Å¿in; murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cuts the throat of mercy, it Å¿tabs all our mercies at the heart, it Å¿ets all a mans mercies a bleeding about him at once, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14. 30.

As you love your mercies, as you would have the Å¿weet of your mercies, and as you would enjoy the life of your mercies, take heed of murmuring; mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring will bring a conÅ¿umption upon your mercies, it is a worm that will make all your mercies to wither. As there bee Å¿ome that
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170508:92"/> love their mercies into the grave, and others that plot their mercies into the grave: Å¿o there bee Å¿ome that murmure their mercies into the grave. As you would have your mercies alwaies freÅ¿h and green, Å¿miling and thriving, as you would have your mercies to bed and board with you, to riÅ¿e up, and lye down with you, and in all conditions to attend you; murmure not, murmure not; the mute ChriÅ¿tians mercies are moÅ¿t Å¿weet, and moÅ¿t long-liv'd; the murmurers mercies, like <hi>Jonab</hi>'s Gourd, will quickly wither.

                  <p>Fifthly, The longer you have been afflicted, the more in Å¿piritual experiences you have been enrich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 5.

Now, the more grace here, the more glory hereafter; the higher in grace, the higher in glory.

Now certainly, the more like to ChriÅ¿t, the more beloved of ChriÅ¿t; the more a ChriÅ¿tian is like to ChriÅ¿t, the more hee is the delight of ChriÅ¿t; and the more like to ChriÅ¿t on earth, the nearer the Å¿oul Å¿hall Å¿it to ChriÅ¿t in Heaven; nothing makes a man more conformable to ChriÅ¿t than afflictions. <hi>Justin Martyr</hi> (in his Å¿econd Apology for the ChriÅ¿tians) hath obÅ¿erved, that there is Å¿carce any prediction or prophecy concerning our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our ChriÅ¿t the Son of God to bee made man, but the Heathen wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters (who were all after <hi>MoÅ¿es</hi>) did from thence invent Å¿ome fable, and feign it to have been acted by Å¿ome one or other of <hi>Jupiters</hi> Sons, onely the Prophecies about the croÅ¿s of

                  <p>Secondly, It may bee thou art under Å¿ome preÅ¿ent diÅ¿temper that diÅ¿-inables thee to make a right judgement of the different dealings<note place="margin">Deut. 28. 28.

                  <p>I have read of a fooliÅ¿h Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, who to Å¿hew the greatneÅ¿s of his City, made Å¿hew of many Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; when the mind is diÅ¿turbed, men many times Å¿ay they know not what, and do they know not what; it may be when theÅ¿e clouds are blown over, and thy mind cleared, and thy judgement Å¿etled, thou wilt bee of another opinion.

                  <p>Fourthly, Though thy afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are greater than this and that particular mans afflictions, yet doubtleÅ¿s there are many thouÅ¿ands in the world, whoÅ¿e afflictions are greater than thine: CanÅ¿t thou Å¿e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouÅ¿ly conÅ¿ider the Å¿ore calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and miÅ¿eries that the devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Å¿word hath brought upon ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouÅ¿and ChriÅ¿tians in forein parts, and Å¿ay that thy afflictions are greater than theirs?

                  <p>Fifthly, As thy afflictions are greater than other mens, Å¿o it may bee thy mercies are greater than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:170508:143"/> mens mercies, and if Å¿o, thou haÅ¿t no cauÅ¿e but to hold thy peace; as <hi>Jobs</hi> afflictions were greater than other mens, Å¿o his mercies were greater that other<note place="margin">Job 1</note> mens; and <hi>Job</hi> wiÅ¿ely Å¿ets one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainÅ¿t another, and then laies his hand upon his mouth.

                  <p>Sixthly and laÅ¿tly, By great af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions the Lord may greaten thy graces, and greaten thy name and<note place="margin">James 5. 10, 11</note> fame in the world; by <hi>Jobs</hi> great

Certainly, if thou art dear to ChriÅ¿t, hee will greaten thee in Å¿pirituals, by all the great afflictions that are upon thee; hee will raiÅ¿e thy faith, and inflame thy love, and quicken thy hope, and brighten thy zeal, and perfect thy patience, and perfume thy name, and make it<note place="margin">Prov. 22. 1 EccleÅ¿. 7. 1</note> like a precious ointment, like a preciou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

And the Lord Å¿aid, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, Simon, behold Satan hath deÅ¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to have you, that hee may Å¿ift you as wheat: But I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not:</hi> Satan would fain have been Å¿haking of him up and down, as wheat is Å¿haken in a fan, but ChriÅ¿ts interceÅ¿Å¿ion fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿trates Satans deÅ¿igned temptations: when ever Satan Å¿tands at our el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bows to tempt us, ChriÅ¿t Å¿tands at his Fathers to intercede for us, <hi>Heb. 7. 25. Hee ever lives to make interceÅ¿Å¿ion.</hi> Some of the learned think, that ChriÅ¿t intercedes onely by virtue of his merits, others think that it is done onely with his mouth, probably it may bee done both waies, the rather becauÅ¿e hee hath a tongue (as alÅ¿o a whole glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied body) in Heaven, and is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that that mouth which pleaded Å¿o much for us on earth, Å¿hould be<note place="margin">Joh. 17.</note>
                     <pb n="266" facs="tcp:170508:147"/> altogether Å¿ilent for us in Heaven?

When Satan puts in his pleas, and commences Å¿ute upon Å¿ute againÅ¿t us, ChriÅ¿t Å¿till under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes our cauÅ¿e, hee anÅ¿wers all his pleas, and non-Å¿utes Satan at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry turn, and in deÅ¿pite of Hell hee keep us up in divine favour; when Satan pleads, Lord here are Å¿uch and Å¿uch Å¿ins that thy children have committed, and here are Å¿uch and Å¿uch duties that they have omitted, and here are Å¿uch and Å¿uch mercies that they have not improved, and here are Å¿uch and Å¿uch ordinances that they have Å¿lighted, and here are Å¿uch and Å¿uch motions of the Spirit, that they have quenched: divine JuÅ¿tice, anÅ¿wers, All this is true; but ChriÅ¿t hath appeared on

                  <p>Fifthly and LaÅ¿tly, All temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that the Saints meet with, Å¿hall work much for their good,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:170508:148"/> they Å¿hall bee much for their gain, the profit and advantage that will redound to tempted Å¿ouls by all their temptations, is very great; now this will appear to bee a moÅ¿t<note place="margin">Rom. 8. 28 Jam. 1. 12.</note> certain truth, by an induction of particulars, thus:</p>
                  <p>FirÅ¿t, By temptations God mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplies and encreaÅ¿es his childrens Å¿piritual experiences; the encreaÅ¿e of which is better than the encreaÅ¿e<note place="margin">Rom 5. 3, 4 Frequent engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments add to the Å¿ouldiers skill, and much en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaÅ¿e his experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.</note> of gold; in the Å¿chool of temptation God gives his children the greateÅ¿t experience of his power Å¿upporting them, of his word comforting of them, of his mercy warming of them, of his wiÅ¿dome counÅ¿elling of them, of his faithfulneÅ¿s joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, and of his grace Å¿trengthening of them, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 9. My grace Å¿hall bee Å¿ufficient for thee. Paul</hi> never experienced Å¿o deeply what Almighty power was, what the everlaÅ¿ting arms of mercy were, and what infinite grace and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neÅ¿s, as when hee was under the buffetings of Satan.</p>
                  <pb n="269" facs="tcp:170508:148"/>
                  <p>Secondly, All their temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons Å¿hall bee phyÅ¿ical, their temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations Å¿hall bee happy preventions of great abominations, 2 <hi>Cor. 12. 7. LeÅ¿t I Å¿hould bee exalted, lest I</hi>

                     <hi>Å¿hould bee exalted,</hi> it is twice in that one verÅ¿e, hee begins with it, and hee ends with it; if hee had not been buffeted, hee might have been more highly exalted in his own conceit, than hee was before in his exÅ¿tacie. Ah tempted Å¿ouls! you Å¿ay you are naught, very naught, but had it not been for the Å¿chool of temptation, you might have been Å¿tark naught before this time; you Å¿ay you are Å¿ick, you are even Å¿ick to death, why your Å¿ickneÅ¿Å¿e had before this time killed you, had not temptations been phyÅ¿ical to you; you are bad under temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but doubtleÅ¿s you would have been much worÅ¿e, had not God made temptation a diet-drink to you.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, Temptations Å¿hall much promote the exerciÅ¿e of
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:170508:149"/> grace, as the Å¿pring in the watch Å¿ets all the wheels a going; and as <hi>Solomons</hi> virtuous woman Å¿et all her<note place="margin">Prov. 30. 10,â<hi>ult.</hi> 1 Pet. 1. 6, 7</note> maidens to work: So temptation Å¿ets faith on work, and love on work, and repentance on work, and hope on work, and holy fear on work, and godly Å¿orrow on work.<note place="margin">Tapers burn clea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reÅ¿t in the dark.</note> As the wind Å¿ets the Mill at work, Å¿o the wind of temptation Å¿ets the graces of the Saints a going; now faith runs to ChriÅ¿t, now it hugs a promiÅ¿e, now it pleads the blood of ChriÅ¿t, now it looks to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of reward, now it takes the Å¿word of the Spirit, &amp;c. now<note place="margin">Cant. 3. 6, 7</note> love cleaves to ChriÅ¿t, now love hangs upon ChriÅ¿t, now love will fight it out to the death for ChriÅ¿t, now hope flies to the horns of the Sanctuary, now hope puts on her helmet, now hope caÅ¿ts her anchor upon that within the veil, &amp;c.<note place="margin">Heb. 6. 19</note> Grace is never more acted, than when a ChriÅ¿tian is moÅ¿t tempted. Satan made a bow of <hi>Jobs</hi> wife (of his Rib, as <hi>ChryÅ¿oÅ¿tome</hi> Å¿peaks) and Å¿hot a tentation by her at <hi>Job,</hi>
                     <pb n="271" facs="tcp:170508:149"/> thinking to have Å¿hot him to the heart, <hi>curÅ¿e God and dye,</hi> but the activity of <hi>Jobs</hi> graces was a breaÅ¿t<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate that made him temptation<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proof; the Devil tempting <hi>Bona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture,</hi> told him hee was a repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, and therefore perÅ¿waded him to drink in the preÅ¿ent pleaÅ¿ures of this life (for Å¿aith hee) thou art ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the future joyes with God in Heaven (<hi>Bonaventures</hi> gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces being active) hee anÅ¿wers, no, not Å¿o Satan, if I muÅ¿t not enjoy God after this life, let mee enjoy him as much as I can in this life.</p>
                  <p>Fourthly, By temptations the Lord will make you the more Å¿er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable and uÅ¿efu to others; none Å¿o fit and able to relieve tempted<note place="margin">The skil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuleÅ¿t com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manders and lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are of greateÅ¿t Å¿ervice and uÅ¿e to the Å¿ouldiers.</note> Å¿ouls, to Å¿ympathize with tempted Å¿ouls, to Å¿uccour tempted Å¿ouls, to counÅ¿el tempted Å¿ouls, to pitty tempted Å¿ouls, to Å¿upport tempted Å¿ouls, to bear with tempted Å¿ouls, and to comfort tempted Å¿ouls, as thoÅ¿e who have been in the Å¿chool
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:170508:150"/> of temptations, 2 <hi>Cor. 1. 3, 4. BleÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿ed bee God, even the Father of our Lord JeÅ¿us ChriÅ¿t, the Father of mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and the God of all comfort; Who comforteth us in all our tribulation, that wee may bee able to comfort them which are in any trouble, by the comfort wherewith wee our Å¿elves are comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God.</hi> By temptations God trains up his Å¿ervants, and fits and capacitates them to Å¿uccour and Å¿helter their fellow brethren. One tempted ChriÅ¿tian, Å¿aith <hi>Luther,</hi> is<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luther</hi> in Gen. 27. Rev. 2. 24</note> more profitable and uÅ¿eful to other ChriÅ¿tians, than a hundred (I may add, than a thouÅ¿and) that have not known the depths of Satan, that have not been in the Å¿chool of temptation; hee that is MaÅ¿ter of Arts in the Å¿chool of temptation, hath learned an Art to comfort, to Å¿uccour, and gently to handle tempted and diÅ¿treÅ¿Å¿ed Å¿ouls, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely beyond what all humane Arts can reach unto; no Doctor to him that hath been a Doctor in the Å¿chool of temptation, all other Doctors are but illiterate dunces to him.</p>

                  <p>Fifthly, It is an honour to the Saints to bee tempted, and in the iÅ¿Å¿ue to have an honourable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queÅ¿t ever the tempter; it was a great honour to <hi>David,</hi> that hee Å¿hould be put to fight hand to hand<note place="margin">1 Sam. 17.</note> with <hi>Goliah,</hi> and in the iÅ¿Å¿ue to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome him; but it was a far <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 span">

                  <p>Sixthly, By temptations the Lord will make his people more frequent and more abundant in the work of prayer; every temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation proves a Å¿trong alarm to prayer.

If his children forÅ¿ake my Law, and walk not in my commandements; If they break my Å¿tatutes, and keep not my commandements;</hi> in theÅ¿e words you have a Å¿uppoÅ¿iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the Saints may fall both into Å¿ins of commiÅ¿Å¿ion, and Å¿ins of omiÅ¿Å¿ion; in the following words you have Gods gracious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miÅ¿e, <hi>Then will I viÅ¿it their tranÅ¿<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greÅ¿Å¿ions

Hence it is that God is called the terrible God, keeping covenant and mercy, <hi>Neh.</hi> 1. 5. BecauÅ¿e by his covenant of mercy hee is bound to afflict and chaÅ¿tiÅ¿e his people. God by covenant is bound to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erve his people, and not to Å¿uffer them to periÅ¿h, and happy are they that are preÅ¿erved, whether in Salt and Vinegar, or in Wine and Sugar: All the afflictions that
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170508:195"/> come upon a wicked man, come upon him by virtue of a cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of works, and Å¿o are curÅ¿t un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him; but all the afflictions that come upon a gracious man, they come upon him by virtue of a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of grace, and Å¿o they are bleÅ¿t unto him; and therefore hee hath eminent cauÅ¿e to hold his peace, to lay his hand upon his mouth.</p>
               <p>Eighthly, If you would bee Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and quiet under afflictions, then dwell much upon this, <hi>viz.</hi> that all your afflictions do but reach the worÅ¿er, the baÅ¿er, and the ignobler part of a ChriÅ¿tian, <hi>viz.</hi> his body, his outward man.<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4. 16.</note> Though our outward man decay, yet our inward man is renewed day by day. As <hi>AriÅ¿tarchus</hi> the Heathen, Å¿aid, when hee was beaten by the Tyrants, Beat on, it is not <hi>AriÅ¿tarchus</hi> you beat, it is<note place="margin">1 Tim. 5. 23 3 John 2.</note> onely his Å¿hell. <hi>Timothy</hi> had a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry healthful Å¿oul in a crazy body, and <hi>Gaius</hi> had a very proÅ¿perous

Now, all the troubles and afflictions that a ChriÅ¿tian meets with, they do not reach his Å¿oul, they touch not his conÅ¿cience, they make no breach upon his noble part; and therefore hee hath cauÅ¿e to hold his peace, and to lay his hands upon his mouth; the Å¿oul is the breath of God, the beauty of man, the wonder of Angels, and the envy<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 9 Zach. 12. 1</note> of Devils, it is a caeleÅ¿tial plant, and of a divine off-Å¿pring; it is an immortal Å¿pirit; Å¿ouls are of an Angelick nature, a man is an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel cloathed in clay; the Å¿oul is a greater miracle in man, than all the miracles wrought amongÅ¿t men; the Å¿oul is a <hi>demi-Å¿emi</hi>-God dwelling in a houÅ¿e of clay. Now, it is not in the power of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny outward troubles and afflictions that a ChriÅ¿tian meets with, to
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170508:196"/> reach his Å¿oul; and therefore hee may well Å¿it mute under the Å¿marting Rod.</p>
               <p>Ninthly, If thou wouldeÅ¿t bee Å¿ilent and quiet under the Å¿addeÅ¿t providences, and Å¿oreÅ¿t trials, then keep up Faith in continual exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciÅ¿e; Now Faith in the exerciÅ¿e of it will quiet and Å¿ilence the Å¿oul; thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1 By bringing the Å¿oul to Å¿it<note place="margin">Joh. 14. 8 PÅ¿a. 17. 15</note> down Å¿atisfied in the naked enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God.</p>

               <pb n="365" facs="tcp:170508:196"/>
               <p>Tenthly, If you would keep Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then keep humble before the Lord. Oh! labour every day to bee more humble, and more low, and little in your own eyes; who<note place="margin">Job 7. 1, 18</note> am I, Å¿aith the humble Å¿oul, but that God Å¿hould croÅ¿s mee in this mercy, and take away that mercy, and paÅ¿s a Å¿entence of death upon every mercy? I am not worthy of the leaÅ¿t mercy, I deÅ¿erve not a crum of mercy, I have forfeited<note place="margin">Prov. 13. 16</note> every mercy, I have improved ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a mercy. Onely by pride comes contention; it is onely pride that puts men upon contending with God and men; an humble Å¿oul will lye quiet at the foot of God, it will bee contented with bare com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons; As you Å¿ee Å¿heep can live upon the bare Commons, which a fat Oxe cannot. A Dinner of green herbs reliÅ¿heth well with the humble mans palate, whereas a Å¿talled Oxe is but a courÅ¿e diÅ¿h to a proud mans Å¿tomack; an humble heart thinks none leÅ¿s than him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿elf, nor none worÅ¿e than himÅ¿elf;

               <p>Eleventhly, If you would keep Å¿ilence under the afflicting hand of God, then keep cloÅ¿e, hold faÅ¿t theÅ¿e Å¿oul-Å¿ilencing and Å¿oul-quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing maxims or principles. As</p>
               <p>FirÅ¿t, That the worÅ¿t that God doth to his people in this world, is in order to the making of them a Heaven on Earth; hee brings them into a wilderneÅ¿s, but it is, that hee may Å¿peak comfortably to them: he<note place="margin">HoÅ¿. 2. 14</note> caÅ¿ts them into the fiery furnace,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170508:197"/> but it is, that they may have more of his company; doe the Å¿tones come thick and threefold about <hi>Stephens</hi> ears? it is but to knock<note place="margin">Act. 7.</note> him the nearer to ChriÅ¿t, the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner-Å¿tone, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Secondly, If you would bee Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, then hold faÅ¿t this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That what God wills is beÅ¿t;<note place="margin">Heb. 12. 10</note> when hee wills Å¿ickneÅ¿s, Å¿ickneÅ¿s is better than health; when hee wills weakneÅ¿s, weakneÅ¿s is better than Å¿trength; when hee wills want, want is better than wealth; when hee wills reproach, reproach is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than honour; when hee wills death, death is better than life. As God is wiÅ¿dome it Å¿elf, and Å¿o knows that which is beÅ¿t, Å¿o hee is goodneÅ¿s it Å¿elf, and therefore can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do any thing but that which is beÅ¿t; therefore hold thy peace.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, If thou wouldeÅ¿t bee Å¿ilent under thy greateÅ¿t afflictions, then hold faÅ¿t to this principle, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Lord will bear thee com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170508:198"/> in all thy afflictions, <hi>IÅ¿a. 41. 10, ch. 43. 2. PÅ¿al. 23. 4. PÅ¿al. 90. 15. Dan. 3. 25. Gen. 39. 20, 21. 2 Tim.</hi> 4. 16, 17.

               <p>Fourthly, If you would bee Å¿i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent under your afflictions, then hold faÅ¿t this principle, that the Lord hath more high, more noble, and more bleÅ¿Å¿ed ends in the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of you, than hee hath in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting of the men of the world. The Å¿talk and the ear of corn fall upon the threÅ¿hing flore, under one and the Å¿ame flail, but the one is Å¿hattered in peeces, the other is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿erved; from one and the Å¿ame Olive, and from under one and the Å¿ame preÅ¿s is cruÅ¿hed out both Oil and dreggs, but the one is tunn'd up for uÅ¿e, the other thrown out as unÅ¿erviceable; and by one and the Å¿ame breath the fields are perfumed
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170508:198"/> with Å¿weetneÅ¿s, and annoyed with unpleaÅ¿ant Å¿avours: Å¿o, though af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions do befall good and bad a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like, as the Scripture Å¿peaks, yet<note place="margin">EccleÅ¿. 9. 2</note> the Lord will effect more glorious ends by thoÅ¿e afflictions that befall his people, than hee will effect by thoÅ¿e that befall wicked men; and therefore the Lord puts his people into the furnace, for their trial<g ref="char:punc">âª</g> but the wicked for their ruine; the one is bettered by affliction, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is made worÅ¿e; the one is made Å¿oft and tender by afflictions, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is more hard and obdurate; the one is drawn nearer to God by af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions, the other is driven further from God, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Fifthly, If you would bee Å¿ilent under your afflictions, then you muÅ¿t hold faÅ¿t this principle, <hi>viz.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Matth. 15. 21,â29</note> That the beÅ¿t way in this world to have thine own will, is to lye down in the will of God, and quietly to reÅ¿ign up thy Å¿elf to the good will and pleaÅ¿ure of God. <hi>Luther</hi> was a man that could have any thing of
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170508:199"/> God, and why? why becauÅ¿e hee Å¿ubmitted his will to the will of God, hee loÅ¿t his will in the will of God. Oh Å¿oul! it Å¿hall bee even as thou wilt, if thy will bee Å¿wallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up in the will of God.</p>
               <p>Sixthly and laÅ¿tly, If thou would<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eÅ¿t bee Å¿ilent under the afflicting hand of God, then thou muÅ¿t hold<note place="margin">PÅ¿a. 94. 19 Dan. 9. 19,â24 Gen. 28. 7 Act. 16. &amp; 27, ch.

               <p>Twelfthly and laÅ¿tly, To Å¿ilence and quiet your Å¿ouls under the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting hand of God, dwell much upon the brevity or Å¿hortneÅ¿s of
